Since we were the first HTTP server in BC, you may have come here expecting to find the University of British Columbia or the province of British Columbia . They're broken down into major categories and presented in a narrative style. If that doesn't appeal to you, there's a menu-style list of everything here. Computer Science Department You can read a little about the department and see the people behind it and what they do . Check out our list of seminars and speaker series featuring people from the department and around the world. Our 1995 Annual Report and Technical reports on the research done in the department are available on-line. The department is involved in CICSR , the Centre for Integrated Computer Systems Research. There are many different ways, electronic and otherwise, to contact the department . If you'd like to apply for graduate school here, we have some application forms available. There are other forms for internal use . Or you can just jump right in and find out how to make your documents available to the world . Contact phillips@cs.ubc.ca if you'd like a copy. You can even read about setting up your own HTTP server , but CS people probably don't need to go to the trouble. Facilities The department's computers consistly largely of UNIX workstations with some Macintoshes and PCs lying around. Library The department has its own reading room , but you should take a look at the list of electronic jounals and other on-line information. The second is a gateway to our anonymous FTP archives at ftp.cs.ubc.ca and features the ability to browse straight into zip files without having to load them entirely over to your site. UBC, BC and the World If you're looking for UBC related information, starting with our list of UBC information servers may help. Our teeny British Columbia page will guide you to many other web servers in province. It's essentially the collected wisdom of many USENET groups whose topics are quite diverse.\n",

It was approved on campus in 1969 and approved by SUNY Central and registered by the State Education Department in 1970. The first student graduated in 1971 and today the programs housed in our department total 200 majors. In 1988 a multidisciplinary committee designed the Information Science major, the second such registered program in New York. In 1990, SUNY Oswego began offering programs that might be completed with evening courses only and the Information Science Evening Degree Program was the second degree offered. In 1995 the Computer Science Department delivered the first course SUNY Oswego offered via distance learning. Press Release! Japanese scholars visit to compare technology.
