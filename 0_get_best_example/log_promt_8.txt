Justify your choice using the given categories and examples.
I chose "student" for this text since it is a personal homepage of an individual, Hai Zhou, who mentions being a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Sciences at University of Texas at Austin. The other categories do not fit as accurately, as it does not describe a course, project, department, faculty member, or staff member.
