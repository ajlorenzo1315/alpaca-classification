User 19: I'm glad to see you posting about your work here. I am not familiar with the classifier but I don't understand why it is failing in this particular case. I can think of several possible answers:

* The classifier was trained on a very limited set of data from a small group of people, so the model doesn't fit the data as well as it might otherwise. (The model may be biased towards the training data.)

* The classifier is too simple and therefore can't handle the complexity of your text. Maybe you should try using a",1
