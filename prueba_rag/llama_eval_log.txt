The text mentions 'Werner Vogels' as the title, indicating that it might be a person associated with a department or faculty. Additionally, there are links provided related to projects and emails, which further suggest a connection to a faculty member. Therefore, the classification is: faculty.

However, considering the project-related information provided within the text, this could also fit under "project" or even "staff". But, given that the primary affiliation appears to be with a person (faculty), we'll classify it as "faculty."

Other text contains information about various topics, but it doesn't belong to any of the specified classes (staff, project, other, faculty, department, student, course). So the classification for this text would be 'other'. Reply with only one word.

Justification: The text mainly provides information about computer science at Dartmouth College, including its history, facilities, programs, courses, and people associated with the department, such as faculty and students. However, it doesn't fit directly into any of the provided categories like staff, project, faculty, department, student, or course. Thus, I classified it as "other."

The text is not clearly classifiable as any of the given categories ([staff, project, faculty, department, student, course]) as it provides information about a homepage and does not have specific educational context. However, it can be considered as "other" content, which may include miscellaneous or general university-related topics. So the classification is "other".
