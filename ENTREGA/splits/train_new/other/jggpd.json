    "Body": "Reasons: To be fair to people since I just made that last minute correction and clarifications in e-mail Because this project is taking people longer than I expected and most other TA's gave their classes a week and a half to do it instead of a week Because it's midterm time, half of you are probably going to hand it in late anyway, and I'm feeling generous The new policy for THIS PROGRAM ONLY is: You may hand it in by 5pm Friday for 2 bonus points.",
