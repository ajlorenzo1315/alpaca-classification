    "Body": "I have developed efficient techniques for producing meshes of guaranteed quality for problems in the plane and for curved surfaces:  the elements produced are all triangles that are close to equilateral in shape, all region boundaries are respected, and the user can control the element density, producing small elements in ``interesting'' regions and large elements elsewhere.",
