    "Body": "This project focuses on the analysis of visual motion, including optical flow estimation in the presence of discontinuities, extracting shape properties in a qualitative manner that avoids much of the complexity and noise sensitivity of tranditional structure-from-motion methods, and detecting moving objects in the environment when the sensor might also be moving.",
