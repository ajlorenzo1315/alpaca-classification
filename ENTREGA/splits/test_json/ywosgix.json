A (fairly primitive) program for playing with Holographic Reduced Representations (Plate) is at ~gasser/Apps/hrr on the sharkestra, moose, and department SGIs. Topics This course provides an introduction to the field of natural language processing (or computational linguistics), including both analysis and generation. Speech processing, machine translation, and computational approaches to language acquisition and language evolution are also given some attention. The course is divided into two relatively separate components. The first deals with symbolic approaches to language processing. With respect to theory and notation, we will stick mainly with Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar , probably the most popular approach in computational linguistics today. Thus we will look at morphology, approaches to parsing, and semantic case, for example, in each case considering how both symbolic and connectionist/statistical approaches deal with the problem. For each topic we will also look at acquisition as well as processing. Coursework and Prerequisites Students should have some background in AI (such as C563-564 ) and be able to program in Scheme or Lisp. Coursework includes Project (50%) This may be done in collaboration with others in the class. It should include a running program, though this can be based on existing software in the case of connectionist models, and a report which relates the work to other work in the area. You need only take the portion of each exam covering the approach (symbolic or connectionist/statistical) which is not related to your project. Here 's a schedule. A copy will also be left in a box in the Computer Science Department Copy Room.
