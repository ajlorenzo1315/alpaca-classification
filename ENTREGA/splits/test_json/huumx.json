(It's a great place to raise kids.) I received my B.S. in Computer Science and in Mathematics at SUNY Stony Brook in 1987 and my Masters in Computer Science at Brown University in 1990; my Masters' advisor was Jeff Vitter . I am now pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at NYU. Research Research interests Storage Systems, Parallel I/O, Parallel File Systems, Hierarchical Memory Models. My .bib files have many references for the above areas: parallel-disk-model.bib secondary-storage.bib memory-hierarcy.bib file-systems.bib parallel-machines.bib misc.bib If you find any errors, please send me corrections. I am working on my dissertation on self-managing storage systems as a visiting scholar at HP Labs with the Storage Systems Program , under the direction of John Wilkes. I am currently working on modeling realistic storage devices ; one use of such a model for attribute-managed storage. A more coherent view of my work is found in this one-page paper . Self-managing storage systems, which is one possible application of my work, is decided in an OSDI work-in-progress paper . (See the published papers section.)
