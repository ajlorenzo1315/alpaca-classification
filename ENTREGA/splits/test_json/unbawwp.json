Harvey Tim Harvey Research Programmer Department of Computer Science Rice University Background After receiving his Bacherlors' Degree in Computer Science from Rice University in 1988, Tim Harvery went to PRC, a subcontractor to NASA, where he worked as programmer and technical lead building some of the support software on the Space Station Freedom project. In 1991, Tim came back to Rice to work on the Massively Scalar Compiler project. He helped design the ILOC language and implement the parser and support routines (the shared code ) which serve as a platform upon which all of the MSCP optimization passes are written. After finishing the shared libraries, Tim has kept busy by writing an implementation of Wegman and Zadeck's Sparse Conditional Constant Propagation algorithm. He also wrote an SSA-based peephole optimization pass. His implementation of dominator calculation based on the algorithm by Cytron et al. is available by ftp. His implementation of a Static Single Assignment form converter is also available. Current Work Tim is currently working on a reimplementation/webification/augmentation of Preston Briggs' register allocator. Future work Tim is going to be looking at new implementations of register allocators. Other Projects Learning who Robert H.
