To convey subscripts, superscripts, and other visual attributes, vary audio state along a dimension that is orthogonal  to (independent of ) the dimension used to convey sub-expressions. audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript Section 3 Knuth's examples of fractions and exponents. Notice that all of these examples comprise of the same 6 symbols, but are very different! AsTeR can render these as unambiguously as TeX can. audio LaTeX Postscript Section 5 Simple School algebra. Notice the choice of unambiguous renderings for the following expressions: audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript Section 7 Trigonometric identities. The first of these examples, probably the most innocuous, is also the most difficult to recognize; it is impossible to determine the variable of integration. Notice that AsTeR interprets triple integrals as the nested application of the integral operator. The following section is meant to illustrate AsTeR's rendering of cross-references, and is most effective when AsTeR is used interactively. audio LaTeX Postscript Section 18 Faa de Bruno's formula. I first heard it spoken by a RFB reader on a talking book; it took 120 seconds to speak. Since the renderings produced by AsTeR utilize features of the audio space not available to a human reader (I still have not met a reader who can change the size and shape of her  head as she talks:-) the rendering takes under 80 seconds. Later, we present rendering using variable substitution, a powerful technique for conveying top-level structure of complex expressions. audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript Here is Faa De Bruno's formula in all its glory:- Audio (66 seconds) LaTeX Postscript AsTeR can process complex expressions like the above, and upon request, replace complex sub-expressions with meaningful identifiers. Such renderings convey top-level structure; the listener can then listen to the sub-expressions separately. Since this substitution process is performed by AsTeR, there is no LaTeX or Postscript equivalent for the audio output in this case. audio (14 seconds) T.V.",
