Topics and Wakerly sections 2\tCh. 5\tComputer organization. Newsgroup The newsgroup for the C335 sections for Fall 1996 is ac.c.335 on the Computer Science departmental network. The instructional staff will post solutions on the class newsgroup or in the laboratory (Lindley Hall 135). You will receive additional handouts and information in class or in lab. Both the lectures and the laboratory sessions discuss much material that is not available in the textbook or lab manual. Cases of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Office of Student Ethics, a branch of the Office of the Dean of Students. C335 Computer Structures Course Description In C335 students study computer systems and problem solving in the context of basic computer hardware and low-level software systems. The abstractions are reinforced in class and in the laboratory. In the laboratory students extend their problem-solving skills by working at the level of computer assembly language using a modern microcomputer system such as the 68000. Although the class and laboratory proceed on their own schedules, the lab applies many of the fundamental concepts dealt with in lecture, and the lecture provides the foundation for the lab. Number systems and arithmetic: Conversions among various number bases such as decimal, binary, hexadecimal, and arbitrary base. Computer data flow: the system bus in a microcomputer. Computer instruction sets: classes of instructions, operands and operations, introduction to addressing modes, operation codes. Addressing modes, including register direct, memory direct, register indirect, memory indirect, auto-increment and auto-decrement, immediate, indexed, based, program-counter relative, paged. Interrupts: Basic interrupt processes: hardware and software responsibilities. Circuits with memory. Processor architecture: register and bus structure, basic processor control. Programming laboratory Programming in assembly language on a current processor such as the 68000.",
