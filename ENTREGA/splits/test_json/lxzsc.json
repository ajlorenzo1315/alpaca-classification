    "Cuerpo": "13th, 1996 Proposals SP-2 related projects: Splash benchmarks in CC++ on the SP-2 Splash is a benchmark suite consisting of parallel applications for shared memory machines developed at Stanford. Implement the kernels listed above and one or two applications (depending on the level of difficulty) in CC++ or Split-C. PVM over Active Messages on the SP-2 PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) is a very popular software package that supports parallel computing on networked of workstations. Try improve the performace of PVM by implementing its major communication routines over Active Messages on the SP-2 and benchmark them against Split-C as well as MPI. This is most easily done as a user-level library within Split-C. Split-C benchmark comparison and survey All of the high-end parallel systems in the department can run programs written in the Split-C parallel language: The SP-2, ATM cluster, Fast Ethernet cluster, and multiprocessor SPARCs. One does not have to specify the address of a sender of receiver -- the tuple space is shared between all processes. The project will be to implement Linda run-time system over Active Messages on the SP-2, as an extension to C. The work will include understanding of Linda model and using fast communication subsystem and threads in order to get very efficient run-time system. In these projects you will augment the existing U-Net system, either on one of these implementations, or combining several of them. CUsee-me over the ATM network or over Fast Ethernet Implement and demo a high-speed version of CUSeeMe over the ATM network or over Fast Ethernet. An alternative to CUSeeMe would be a system such as the MBONE using 'vat', or some other 'free' video conferencing package such as ivs. Gateway between Fast Ethernet and ATM using U-Net Design and build a gateway between Fast Ethernet and ATM using U-Net. Kernel Endpoint for U-Net One 'problem' with U-Net is that it doesn't allow existing applications and kernel facilities to easily share the network device with U-Net. You would not need to implement IP or other high-level protocols; essentially you would replace the low-level kernel functions for sending data to an ATM or Ethernet card with routines which read/write to the kernel endpoint. The best platform for this is the ATM or Fast Ethernet implementation of U-Net on Linux. Implement a simple IPv4 packet filter for either U-Net for Fast Ethernet or ATM, so that packets are in the correct IPv4 format. Distributed Shared Memory Pick up last year's DSM project, make it work and run the Splash benchmarks over it. Those who will be using the cluster to run split-c programs and other application programs may also find the toolkit useful. PVM over U-Net using USIT PVM is a popular software package that allows a heterogeneous network of parallel and serial computers to appear as a single concurrent computational resource. On the other hand, it is widely believed that (a) microkernel based systems are inherently inefficient and (b) they are not sufficiently flexible. We show what performance is achievable, that the efficiency is sufficient with respect to macro-kernels and why some published contradictory measurements are not evident.",
