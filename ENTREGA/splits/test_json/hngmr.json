    "Cuerpo": "There are several example programs given below to show you how to combine objects and animate them. Based on these examples, you will be asked to construct a short animation. If you decide not to look at all of them, you may load them in pairs of *.net and *.cfg. You will need to change the path name in the Import module in the program to reflect the directory in which you copy polyhedra-unit.dx. transform.net transform.cfg windmill.net windmill.cfg cubeflake.net cubeflake.cfg rose.net rose.cfg polyhedra-unit.net polyhedra-unit.cfg polyhedra-unit.dx The first program is an example which shows how to scale, rotate and translate an object. Open the program transform.net and it's control panel and execute it while changing the rotation, translation, and scaling of the simple object (see Image 1 ). The program also allows you to select whether the translate control transforms the object before the scaling and rotation or after them. Image 1 The second program, windmill.net, is an example of a hierarchically modelled, animated object (see Image 2 ) . The object is a windmill constructed from a propellor and a tower. The propellor, in turn, is make up of two blades, a hub and a shaft. The import module reads the vertex list of a cube from polyhedra-unit.dx. Image 4 Image 5 Assignment: Using the three example programs as background, construct one of the objects described below. Also use the shapes defined in the polyhedra-unit.dx file. The animation should be 20 to 100 frames in length. The plane should have wings, tail, engines, and a cockpit canopy. The flower should be constructed from several petals. There must be at least two leaves on the plant. The wings must flap and the feet must move as the bird lands. You will be graded on the correctness of the animation and the readability of the program. You may want to MPEG compress your animation for rapid playback, or if you wish to submit it to the course web pages.",
