Thus, in addition to the opportunity of acquiring specific skills and knowledge by working on a very narrow and interesting problem the opportunity to see and understand the procedure of designing and implementing a complex software for parallel and distributed platforms will be given. Projects : Intelligent Graphical User Interface for AMR Parallel Runtime Support System for AMR Dynamic Load Balancing Algorithms for AMR Parallel PDE solvers using AMR methods Parallel structured grid generation for 2D/3D complex geometries Scientific computing benchmarks for multithreading on parallel and  distributed platforms Study the impact of restructuring CG scalar algorithms and codes in terms of CG's performance on MPPs Intelligent Graphical User Interface for AMR (GUI-AMR) This project requires the design and implement an intelligent frond-end for specifying 2D geometries, operators and various parameters required to solve numerically, time-dependent PDE problems. Parallel Runtime Support System for AMR (PRTS-AMR) This project requires the design and implementation of communication and threaded modules requirted for the efficient implementation of data-movement and control primitives for parallel AMR methods. Existing communication software like MPI, AMs and threaded packages like Qt and PORTS0 will be utilized. This project is recommended for students with interests both on systems, parallel I/O, parallel compilers and computational sciences. The objective is to develop (i) a DLB-AMR module for PRTS-AMR and (ii) acquire useful knowledge in solving an instance of a very difficult combinatorial optimization problem: dynamic load balancing of adaptive computations on a network of time/memory-sharing heterogeneous workstations and MPPs. This project is recommended for students with interests on the solution of practical optimization problems related to parallel and distributed computing. Parallel PDE solvers for time-dependent problems using AMR methods This project requires the implementation of a library of routines for the discretization and solution of 2D/3D wave equation on MPPs and SMPs. Both non-threaded and multithreaded paradigms will be used and evaluated. In addition accuracy, and stability of multithreaded computations will be analyzed. An interaction with PRTS-AMR project is expected. Parallel structured grid generation for 2D/3D complex geometries This project requires the development of parallel algorithms and implementation of a library of parallel grid generation modules using : Algebraic Methods Elliptic Methods Moving Algebraic Methods High-performance languages like HPF and low level like Fortan/C plus message passing will be used. This project is recommented for students with interests in parallel numerical computing. Existing state-of-the-art scalar algorithms and code will be used. Scientific computing benchmarks for multithreading on parallel and distributed platforms Study the impact of restructuring CG scalar algorithms and codes in terms of CG's performance on MPPs This project requires the development of a Conjugate Gradient algorithm suitable for multiprocessors and includes the implementation of CG using Typhoon parallel compiler. Is it worth the effort and possible increase in space complexity? Is it worth in doing the extra step in exploring functional parallelism on top of the data-parallelism? How much will cost to use multithreading in (i) implementing functional parallelism (ii) masking some of the global address space overheads? For more information contact:",
