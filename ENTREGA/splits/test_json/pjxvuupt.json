The concepts discussed are applicable to a variety of systems. CPU scheduling, virtual memory management, input-output systems, disk scheduling, file systems, and protection and security. Knowledge of the C/C++ programming language and familiarity with Unix is required. Other Suggested Textbooks Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment by Stevens, Addison-Wesley Modern Operating Systems by Tanenbaum, Prentice-Hall Assignments You will complete four programming projects, working individually or in groups of two (your decision), relating to the implementation of operating systems. All the programming will be in the C or C++ programming language. There will also be several homework assignments, to be done individually. Grading Grades will be based on two exams, four programming assignments, and several homeworks according to the following tentative weightage: Homeworks: 15% Midterm: 20% Final:\t 25% Four programming projects: 40% From my experience in teaching software courses in the past, most people do very well on programming projects. On the other hand, doing poorly on the programming projects is a sure way to fail the course. Also, note that your grade is only determining your performance during the term. It is not determining your future potential, how well you will be able to apply the course in your employment, etc. Many employers treat the knowledge of the material in the course as being a true test of an experienced software practioner! Policy on Collaboration Unethical behavior such as copying/modifying someone else's project assignment code, looking into other students' directories for material when they do not expect you to, copying homeworks, etc., is not permissible. On the other hand, you are encouraged to discuss homework problems and project assignments with each other. In such a case, please write the names of the students you discussed homeworks or projects on your submissions. However, note that the homework solutions or actual code must not be shared. Class Communication Tools We will use a variety of mechanisms to communicate within the class. Most will have links from the EECS 482 home page at http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~aprakash/482.html. Tools will include class newsgroup, an experimental Java-based chat facility, and of course email.",
