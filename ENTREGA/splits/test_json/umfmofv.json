    "Cuerpo": "If you wish, drop me a line at the following, as I'm always reading my e-mail. Eric Hetherington Places that I, being a total addict, with pretty much nothing else to do but fail out of Grad School, spend most of my non-e-mail-sending-time at. These sites are primarily dedicated to my collecting habits. Other cool sites are listed below. If you have found the pictures and colors and backgrounds to your liking and would like to learn more, check out Joe Burn's Page and he will guide you to excellence. The Starting Line-Up Page ---by Dave, there is no other site like it for SLU information! Beckett Online Ernie White ----the guy who publishes White's Guide .... with some interesting SLU info. If you are interested in something drop me an e-mail and I'll get back to you. In a great attemp not to fill the page with nothing but toys and humor I have turned those  items into other pages and linked them so as to avoid so much clutter and confusion on a single page. It is the best place to start and provides access to other search engines, etc. ***May have problems with freeze ups if browser not advanced enough. Starting Point -- another good choice for a \"starting\" location. CNN Headline News --- a whole days news in 30 minutes. (well, about 5 via the Web Page) ESPN ---the sportszone. Is there anything better than SportsCenter for the sports fanatic? AT&T Research --- all kinds of great things to play with. Here is a great starting location for more Braves info than you could ever really want. Go Braves --- Let's win another one!
