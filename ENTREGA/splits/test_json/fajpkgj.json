Self Image Joe Beef of Montreal, the Son of the People He cares not for Pope, Priest, Parson, or King William of the Boyne; all Joe wants is the Coin. Joe Beef was an inn-keeper at Montreal's harbour in the 1800s, deplored by churchmen as a notorious atheist. Wannabe Author: The Art of Computer Architecture I am constantly on the verge of writing a book entitled \"The Art of Computer Architecture\" - a grabbag of tricks and techniques, sort of an antidote to Hennessy and Patterson - but I cannot afford the diskspace on an Internet service provider or the charges for an always connected system of my own. Interesting Pieces of Computer Architecture One of the best ways to  learn how to be a computer architecture is to read - not textbooks, but datasheets, instruction set references, etc. RCS and Configuration Management Although, or perhaps because, I quit my first real job (at a quickly defunct startup company called Enfoprise, building \"business workstations\") on the first day because they had changed my job assignment from UNIX driver writing to \"Systems Integration\", I have had a longstanding love/hate relationship with configuration management tools like SCCS and RCS. And, overall, I am sufficiently a fan of RCS that I RCS everything , including my .cshrc, .login, and even my web page. Calendar Wisconsin How to arrange meetings with me, etc. : Since there seems to be no ubiquitous calendaring or scheduling program at the university of Wisconsin CS Department - various people use SUN's cmtool, or the public domain ical or plan, but there is not a critical mass of any of these - I am now doing my calendaring in isolation, using the Pilot PDA and its associated PC software. At least this means I can add meetings on the fly. Therefore, to arrange a meeting with me, you must get in touch with me, preferably by email, possibly by phone or in person, so that I can manually add the meeting to my calendar. I have not yet created a way to download my calendar from the Pilot software to a web page. I have not yet created a way to download my calendar from the Pilot software to my Microsoft watch. Intel At Intel, I was a devout user of the group scheduling program - last time I was at Intel, Synchronize (UNIX/PC), but also OnTime in the past - which were weak in that they did not have disconnected operation or email operation, but at least allowed the majority of people in MD6 and MRL to schedule meetings with me without my manual intervention.",
