If you do not purchase a book on a topic, then you will need to access online materials ( that I will point you to later in the semester ) or library materials. ( For old-fashioned access to info: the Engineering library may be a better source than PCL. Drop by and browse! ) <1> The book that you will probably refer to most this semester is a book on Java. The one that I specified to the bookstore is: \" Core Java\" by Cornell and Horstmann, SunSoft Press ( a Prentice Hall title ), 1996, CD-ROM included. <2> For books on Client-Server socket prog., I suggest one of these two: \"Internetworking with TCP/IP Volume III, Client-Server Programming and Applications, BSD Socket Version\" by Doug Comer and David Stevens, Prentice Hall 1993. This book focuses on the different algorithms for designing a client and server. It is more of a \"big-picture\" book than the one below, but it also includes sample code and reference info to make it immediately usable. \"Unix Network Programming \" by Richard Stevens, Prentice Hall, 1990. While this book is a bit older, it is THE book referenced by implementers. For this course you would refer to Chapter 6. I will let you know on Lecture 3 if it is required. \"IPv6 The New Internet Protocol\" , by C. Huitema, Prentice Hall, 1996. Background Reading on TCP/IP protocols Since we will be focused on protocol issues found in the Internet, you will need to start by getting up to speed on the basic concepts found in the Internet Protocols:  particularly IP, UDP, TCP, some routing update protocols, DNS, and some of the application protocols, e.g. smtp, snmp, telnet, ftp/tftp, nntp, http. If you did not get this from CS356, then you may want a reference book or will need to read online info. Two reference books are: Comer, D., \"Internetworking with TCP/IP Principles Protocols and Architecture\" , Volume 1, 3rd ed, Prentice Hall, 1995. ( This is more up to date than Steven's book. Stevens, R., \"TCP/IP Illustrated, The Protocols\" , Volume 1, Addison-Wesley, 1994. ( This book has more examples and details on the TCP and IP protocols, but less of an overview/introduction. )",
