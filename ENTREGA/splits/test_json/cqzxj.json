What to Do Part I: Creating the Program Run Borland C++ and create a new file in which to type in your source code by choosing \"File\" and then \"New\" from the menu. Type in your program. Start with this extremely simple program: one which simply prints out your name and cs110 section number. Then compile and run the program by clicking on the small \"lightning bolt\" icon (or choose \"Debug\" and then \"Run\" from the menu), as in program 0. Then compile and run the program to make sure this part works. Then add the part that performs the computation and prints the results. Run this program a few times, entering different numbers and checking the results to make sure you don't have a \"bug.\" To use the debugger, press the F8 function keyboard (or choose Debug/Next from the menu). When you get to a cin statement, the program will stop and wait for you to type the input in the window. After you type in the input, click on that variable name in your program. In this menu choose Inspect . This brings up a window which shows you the value of that variable. You can use the debugger as many times as you like to investigate the various aspects of your program. (Note: there is nothing to hand in for this part.) To print the output, click on the system menu box (the small horizontal bar) in the upper-left corener of the window which has your program's output. Hello, this program will ask you for your grades and then compute your GPA. It assumes all your classes are 3 credits. How many As did you get? You have a total of 40.5 grade points with 12 credits, for a GPA of 3.375 mbirk@cs.wisc.edu",
