    "Cuerpo": "C Compute the total cost from the C unit cost and quantity ordered TOTCST = UNTCST * QUANTY Continuation Marker If a statement is too long to fit in the 72 columns then it can be split over two or more lines. Put a \" + \" in column 6 to indicate that the line is a continuation of the previous line. END Tells the compiler that this is the last statement in the program and it should stop compiling. Right: TOTCST, QUANTY, INDEX2 Wrong: TotalCost, 2B_Or_Not_2B Variable Types You must explicitly specify the type of each variable; i.e. what sort of value it will store. The most common variable types are: REAL - a real number with a decimal point and fractional part. Constants If the value of a variable is known when you write the program and it never changes (e.g. Pi) then turn it into a constant with the PARAMETER statement. Assignment Statement To store a value to a variable you have declared use the assignment statement . A = B + MOD(C, 4) Type Matching The type of an expression should match the type of the variable the result is going to be stored in. Rounding Errors Numbers are stored inside the computer in binary format (i.e. as powers of 2) 10 base 10 = 2^3 + 2^1 = 1010 base 2 Most fractions cannot be represented precisely in binary (e.g. 0.1) so instead the closest approximimation in base 2 is stored. so 01000001 = 1*2^6 + 1*2^0 = 65 Characters: Convert to ASCII code value (for example 'A' is stored as 01000001 i.e. 65) Reals: Stored in binary version of scientific notation. ab.cd in binary is a*2^1 + b*2^0 + c*2^(-1) + d*2^(-2), just as ab.cd in decimal is a*10^1 + b*10^0 + c*10^(-1) + d*10^(-2) So 1.0100 = 1*2^0 + 1*2^(-2) = 1 + 1/4 = 1.25 Recall in decimal 123.8 becomes 1.238 x 10^2 in sci. notation in binary, we'll have a 1 there. Think of it as 0100 0001 So, in complete binary this is 1.0100 x 10^0001, which converts to (1 + 1/4) x 2^1 = (1.25)*2 = 2.5 CHARACTER Strings To assign a value to a CHARACTER variable it must be either another CHARACTER variable or a string enclosed in single apostrophes. PRINT *, X, ' plus ', Y, ' equals ', X+Y You can print values, variables, arithmetic expressions or CHARACTER strings. PRINT *, 'Please enter the cost of the item' READ *, UNTCST Unformatted Input To read in data entered at the keyboard by the user use the READ statement. READ *, UNTCST You always read in a variable you are specifying where the value is to be stored. 11  20  67 ENTER The values the user types in must be entered in the same order and be the same type as the variables in the READ statement. Saying Y = Z/0, for example, is a legal statement but the computer cannot divide by 0. It will compile, but fail running when the program reached this point. If the B was on the 71st column, however, then only the C would be ignored, and you'd have a syntax error (READ cannot end with a comma).",
