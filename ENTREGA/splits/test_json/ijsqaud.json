    "Cuerpo": "6/2/95 The Question and Answer Session will be on Tuesday, 10:30 - noon, in Sieg 226. The Pentium is right in there with the Sparc, Alpha, and Power PC. 5/22/95 Dan will office hours tomorrow, Tuesday, May 23rd at 12:30 - 1:30. Instead I will be in my office from 12:30 to 1:30 on Fridays starting today. 5/3/95 The Question and Answer Session will be in Sieg 226 at 3:30 today, Wednesday. 4/27/95 I will not be in my office hour on Friday, April 28, from 2:30 - 3:30. There will be a special question and answer session on Wednesday, May 3, at 3:30 in preparation for the exam on Friday the 5th. 4/12/95 I will not be in my office hours on Friday from 2:30 to 3:30. RL 4/7/95 There will a special C++ session in Sieg 226 on Monday, April 10th from 3:30 - 4:20. At least one student pointed out to me that the in the fourth part of problem 2 in homework 2, the result of multiplying two matrices is a matrix not a vector. 4/6/95 I am happy to let you know that the two books I put on reserve in the Engineering Library are ready. It is appendix A of Headington and Riley that would be most helpful for those moving from Ada to C++. I think it would be a good idea to begin reading Chapter 2 of Weiss before tomorrow. 3/31/95 Good news: I brought 5 copies of \"Data Structures and Algorithms in Ada\" by Weiss and three copies of\"Data Abstraction and Structures using C++\" by Headington and Riley to the Engineering Library. Bad news: Because of lack of staff (budget cuts) the books will not be ready to check out for a week. 3/30/95 In problem 1 on the first homework, please use the \"dense\" linked list representation of polynomials. That is, every coefficient is in the list regardless if it is zero or not. RL 3/27/95 The first class met promply at 11:30  am in EE 108 on March 27, 1995. The handouts, Lab. The emacs handout and thumbnails of first lecture are in the hanger outside my office.",
