Prior to that, he was on the faculty of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles. He teaches and conducts research in the areas of computer-aided design and testing of digital systems, computer architecture, VLSI design, and fault-tolerant computing. CURRENT RESEARCH Our  group  is currently conducting research on the following topics: Hierarchical  testing of digital circuits; Built-in self-test (BIST); Design verification; Fault-tolerant architectures  for safety-critical applications; Design with field-programmable gates arrays (FPGAs); Automated layout methods for CMOS cells; and  High-level timing analysis. on VLSI , Notre Dame, Ind., pp. M.
