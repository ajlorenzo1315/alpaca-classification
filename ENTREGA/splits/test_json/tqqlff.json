In particular we will adopt as our case study the software system associated with a World Wide Web server. Code walk-throughs will include: at the kernel level (namely in Linux ), the network, file system, and process scheduling functions; and at the application level, one Web server ( Apache ). This seminar will be a prerequisite or corequisite for participating in the Commonwealth Server Project, which is being led by the instructors; however any student who is interested in studying the implementation of a networked computer system is invited to attend. We will be asking attendees to be notetakers for a week. Students taking this course for credit will be expected to complete a related project chosen in consultation with one of the instructors. We will schedule a brownbag (or two) at the end of the semester. Each student participating will be asked to talk for a short time (10 mins) on their project or on a related topic. If you're a presenter or a scribe for a particular week, please mail your notes to djy@cs.bu.edu so that they can be linked to this home page. World-Wide Web Conference, December, 1995. [Ande96] E.
