For my thesis, I am interested in performance and architectural issues for Time Warp simulations running on shared memory multiprocessors. Outside of my research I am active in organizing Indian classical music concerts. Shiv Kumar Sharma in April 94, and Reena and Rajeeb Chakraborty in Oct 94. I fix cars and like to cook. I am graduating in Dec 96. Here is my resume and a recommendation letter. Meet my wife, Ritu Latest infomation about Indian Classical music concerts, and other India Club activities at Georgia Tech. I went to University of Maryland for my masters in Computer Science. India Club and SPICMACAY upcoming events, pointers to other www pages. Current Research: Parallel and Distributed Simulation My research is shared memory optimizations for high performance Time Warp: efficient message passing, buffer management, and fast continuous GVT calculations for real time applications. May 1996. Buffer Management in Shared Memory Time Warp Systems with Richard Fujimoto, 8th Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Simulation (PADS), June 1995. A high performance message passing system for shared memory multiprocessors is presented, by studing the interaction of memory management in Time Warp with caching and virtual memory.
