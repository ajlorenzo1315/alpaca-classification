Intelligent agent software can assist a user, but current user interfaces are either hard to use or do not fully exploit the agent's capabilities. The audience consists of casual or \"naive\" users of information networks (i.e. The UI Research Issues What are the User Interface research issues that I want to address? How can the user work with the assistant to initially specify, then modify the goals of the search? Specialized Discovery Is it natural to classify types of resource discovery tasks? What user interface metaphors facilitate effective resource management? The Domain This work will use a software robot that can understand and navigate the World Wide Web. As a start I will work on adding an assistant-based interface for resource discovery on top of the Mosaic World Wide Web browser. I have considered two scenarios: Scenario 1 A Mosaic Companion Assistant Scenario 1 would provide a companion application to Mosaic that allows a user to search for Web resources. Initially this would implement a keyword search but it would be built with the idea of adding specialized searches later. The search is carried out by a software agent (so I presume the UI generates a goal that the agent tries to satisfy) which returns a collection of Web resources. The user can then tour the results by directing the companion to control Mosaic remotely. While the search is in progress, the user can continue to work with Mosaic. Future UI experimentation can be plugged in and is not limited by HTML or Mosaic forms. Scenario 2 An Integrated, Assisted Version of Mosaic Approach This approach would provided the same search mechanisms as Scenario 1. Advantages Since this scenario uses the standard Mosaic viewer, it would be available to a much larger audience. Disadvantages This scenario does not provide a fertile UI testbed. It would be more difficult to experiment with metaphors for retaining and organizing collections of known resources. While the agent is working, the user does not have control of the viewer.",
