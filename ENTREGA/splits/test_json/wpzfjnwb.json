    "Cuerpo": "If this window disappears (is backgrounded), do *NOT* click on the Dos Prompt again (that creates a completely seperate window). This is your prompt. The prompt should now say R:\\>. What's a directory? We might have another box called \"handin\", which is where to put all the programs to be handed in. So a directory is just a sort of \"box\" that holds programs and other directories. Inside handin is a bunch of boxes, one of which is tick, and again once box inside tick is YourLoginName . Note that you are now *in* this directory. You can tell because your prompt now says R:\\public\\tick YourLoginName />. copy is a command that copies a program from one place to another...the program in this case is prog0.dat, found in \\public\\tick\\ (you have to use the full path name here...this will always be the directory for things I give you to use). When you type dir, the first 8 letters will show up in one column, followed by a second column which lists the last three. Now you're ready to type up your program (i.e. prog0.for). You can now type on the blue screen, the same as if you were using a typewriter, which is effectively what this is. Go up to file again, and select exit. You need to translate it into machine language so the computer can run it, so now you've got to to compile. They have the same name as your program but with a .obj and a .exe extension. You can now run it by typing in the programname (you can leave out the .exe if you wish) . If so, you'll have to 1) edit the program again and 2) compile it again once you're done editing. DON'T DELETE THE .FOR OR .EXE...you may need them for later programs, plus if your hard copy gets lost we'll need the file. DON'T FORGET TO DO THIS LAST STEP!",
