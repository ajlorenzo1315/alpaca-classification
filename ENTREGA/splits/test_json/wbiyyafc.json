Current and Past Students (I've taught a few thousand, but these are only a few of them) Tutorials, Consulting Tutorials in Parallel Computing: have been taught at U.S. Patent Office , Ford Motor Company, NASA, Supercomputing conferences, etc. The next conference presentation will be at Supercomputing 96. Consulting on Parallel and High-Performance Computing. If interested, please contact me directly - email is usually the best way to reach me. Past Lives Childhood, Euclid, Ohio. Thanks also to Sputnik, for making America improve its science education just in time for me to participate in many innovative programs. Why has Congress forgotten how important such educational investments are??? Undergraduate, Centre College, Danville, Kentucky. It deserves the high ratings it gets among liberal arts colleges. Doctorate, Mathematics Department, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana. My thesis was Schur Multiplication on B(H) , 1977.
