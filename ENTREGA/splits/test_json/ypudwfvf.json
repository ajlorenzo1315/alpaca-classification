Note: the type of the data within this space cannot be inferred. an example of how to calculate the address of an element: takes the address array1 (25 in the example) and puts it into the variable called addr. SO, we need to know 1.  where the array starts (called base address) 2.  size of an element in bytes (to get a byte address) 3.  what the first element is numbered byte address of element[x] = base + size(x - first index) example:     4 x 2 array Need to know: 1. row/column major (storage order) 2. base address 3. size of elements 4. dimensions of the array Your program crashes, or you get an error message if an array index is out of bounds example:      x:  array[1..6] of integer; code. After all,  if your program calculates an address of an element, and then loads that element (by the use of the address), there is no checking to see that the address calculated was actually within the array! given --      a 5 x 3 array byte size elements row major order first_row = 1 first_col = 1 ------------------------- One implementation of a stack out of an array. Need to know: index of TOP OF STACK (tos), often called a stack pointer (sp). sp is a variable that contains the address of the empty location at the top of the stack. A stack could instead be implemented such that the stack pointer points to a FULL location at the top of the stack. (Note that which end of the array the stack grows toward is independent of what sp points to.) getting into the queue is an operation called ENQUEUE.",
