Massy of Stanford and Charles A. Goldman of RAND received widespread attention, stimulated by a New York Times article. Both the study and the article turn out to have been badly flawed. Here is Ullman's report, edited slightly for clarity: It turns out that Bill Massy has just discovered that a critical input parameter to his model -- the total number of doctorates employed in the field -- was incorrect for CS. Table 1.7 (p. 1-32 of the report) has 5,376 for this number. Historical data from NSF, though, shows a steady increase to 19,800 for the two years prior to the year used as input data, and 5,376 for that year. Massy has concluded that the figure of 5,376 is inappropriate for use in his model. He has decided to extrapolate the historical data to a figure of 21,000 instead. We also expect Massy and Goldman to issue a full, revised report shortly. The New York Times article The New York Times article leads one to believe that the Massy-Goldman study was a \"survey,\" when in fact the study involves a first-order Markov model. A statement from the article such as: \"The surplus of doctoral computer science degrees currently awarded over the number of those who get desirable jobs in their field is 50.3 percent ...\" is thus doubly flawed: Because of flaws in the study, the 50.3% should be 3.6%. (Needless to say, a properly constructed, validated, and parameterized model could be useful as a policy planning vehicle.) Here is a comment from Forest Baskett, Vice President and Chief Technology Officer for Silicon Graphics: \"My company hires quite a number of Ph.D.s. These people are now moving up through our organization and becoming the technical and business leaders of the company. I believe that this is a perfectly legitimate role and goal for Ph.D. production even if it is not uppermost in the minds of professors in charge of that production.\" In my mind, opportunities for postdoctoral fellowships allow students to further postpone the making of hard career choices. When students know that they have to actually get a career-defining job at the end of their degree program and they know that academic jobs are no longer easy to find, those students will, I believe, more effectively vote with their feet about courses and research areas in a way that better couples what's happening in our industry to what's happening in our university departments. We have seen this loss of coupling happen in other areas. Physics and life sciences come to mind. \"We've had a fabulous 30 year history of great relations between our computer science departments and a vibrant industry without postdoctoral fellows gumming up the works. Baskett raises important questions concerning the nature of Ph.D. education which deserve serious thought.",
