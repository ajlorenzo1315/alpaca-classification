If you are interested in talking with me, please contact me directly at ywei@math.wisc.edu . Worked on a color-image processing project. 1992-1994: Graduate School of Peking University, Beijing, China. Developped an Multimedia CAI(Computer-Aided Instruction) System, based on MDK(Multimedia Development Kit) of M.S. Windows 3.1, combining voice, graphic, text and animation together. 1992: Great Wall Computer Company, Beijing, China. Worked on an Image Processing Project. 1990-1991: Peking University, Beijing, China. My final project was a 3-D walking robotic , using Phigs and Motif . There are several projects in the course, such as motion blur an image, noise removal, etc., using software MatLab CS540-Artificial Intelligence. There was a programming competition in the class: a robotic want to clean the dirts in a room, and we are asked to write a heuristic function which minimizes both the length of walking route and the running time to find that route. I won the first place. My final project was a Thread Management Package which includes all the nessesary feature of an ordinary Thread Package. My final project is Moving the moose DBMS from Informix to Shore . Here is the code and final report . My final project is the Image Mosaicing .Here is the code and final report . My research topic is the off-line handwriting recognition . (P.R.China) \"Implementation of a Multimedia CAI System\", Technical Report, Peking Univ., Beijing 100871, China, 1994. Research Interest Computer Graphics, Image Processing, Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, Computational Geometry, Multimedia and image database.",
