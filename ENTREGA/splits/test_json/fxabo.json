Mooney Proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Multi-Strategy Learning , pp. This paper presents a novel learning approach for control knowledge acquisition that integrates explanation-based learning with techniques from inductive logic programming. This paper presents SCOPE, a system for learning search-control rules that improve the performance of a partial-order planner. SCOPE integrates explanation-based and inductive learning techniques to acquire control rules for a partial-order planner. Integrating Explanation-Based and Inductive Learning Techniques to Acquire Search-Control for Planning Tara A. Estlin Ph.D. proposal, Department of Computer Sciences, University of Texas at Austin, 1996. Machine learning techniques enable a planning system to automatically acquire domain-specific search-control knowledge for different applications. This paper presents a novel learning approach for control knowledge acquisition that integrates explanation-based learning with techniques from inductive logic programming. In our learning system SCOPE, EBL is used to constrain an inductive search for control heuristics that help a planner choose between competing plan refinements. Second, SCOPE will be more thoroughly tested; several real-world planning domains have been identified as possible testbeds, and more in-depth comparisons will be drawn between SCOPE and other competing approaches. Third, SCOPE will be implemented in a different planning system in order to test its portability to other planning algorithms. This paper presents results on applying a version of the DOLPHIN search-control learning system to speed up a partial-order planner. DOLPHIN integrates explanation-based and inductive learning techniques to acquire effective clause-selection rules for Prolog programs. A version of the UCPOP partial-order planning algorithm has been implemented as a Prolog program and DOLPHIN used to automatically learn domain-specific search control rules that help eliminate backtracking. This paper presents a review of recent work that integrates methods from Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) and Explanation-Based Learning (EBL). Learning Search-Control Heuristics for Logic Programs: Applications to Speedup Learning and Language Acquisition John M. Zelle Ph.D. proposal, Department of Computer Sciences, University of Texas at Austin, 1993. This paper presents a general framework, learning search-control heuristics for logic programs, which can be used to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of knowledge-based systems expressed as definite-clause logic programs. In the area of program optimization, a prototype system, DOLPHIN, is able to transform some intractable specifications into polynomial-time algorithms, and outperforms competing approaches in several benchmark speedup domains. (IJCAI-93) This paper presents an algorithm that combines traditional EBL techniques and recent developments in inductive logic programming to learn effective clause selection rules for Prolog programs. The algorithm is shown to be an improvement over competing EBL approaches in several domains. This paper presents an algorithm that combines traditional EBL techniques and recent developments in inductive logic programming to learn effective clause selection rules for Prolog programs.",
