Smith, Soam Acharya Abstract Current compression formats optimize for either compression or editing. For example, motion JPEG (MJPEG) provides excellent random and moderate overall compression, while MPEG optimizes for compression at the expense of random access. In this paper, we show how to transcode MPEG video to motion-JPEG without fully decompressing the MPEG source. Our experiments show that our compressed domain transcoder is 1.5 to 3 times faster than an optimized spatial domain transcoder, and offers another benefit: a single parameter can improve the speed of transcoding at the expense of the quality of the resulting images. This speed/quality trade-off is important to many real-time applications. This paper presents a video-conferencing application called CU-SeeMe VR that provides a richer interface. CU-SeeMe VR is a distributed video-conferencing system that allows users to connect to 3D worlds and interact with other using live video and audio embedded in a virtual space. Future directions and metaphors for this space are discussed. HTML version Acrobat version (211K) Compressed Domain Processing of JPEG-encoded Images To appear in Real-Time Imaging Journal Brian C. Smith, Lawrence A. Rowe , July, 1996 Abstract This paper addresses the problem of processing motion-JPEG video data in the compressed domain. Using condensation, motion-JPEG video can be processed at near real-time rates on current generation workstations.

Smith , November, 1995 Abstract As common as video processing is, programmers still implement video programs as manipulations of arrays of pixels. HTML version Acrobat version (822K) Query By Humming -- Musical Information Retrieval in an Audio Database Presented at ACM Multimedia 95 . In this paper, a system for querying an audio database by humming is described along with a scheme for representing the melodic information in a song as relative pitch changes.
