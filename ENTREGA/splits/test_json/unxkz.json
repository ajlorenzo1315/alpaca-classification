(Of course NetScape does have some problems displaying HTML... ) Where Am I in the world? Archery at Vassar The Archery Mini-Course Split The Wand! is back. If you want to shoot on campus and are not on my e-mail info list, please send me a note and I will add you to it. For information on these, send me a note and I will put you in touch with the person running them. I would be interested in any stories or information on Archery at Vassar back when it was a team sport. Current Computer Projects and Links MULTEXT and MULTEXT-EAST scripts, projects and links MULTEXT French Site of the Multext project. March 1996. From the abstract \"The CES has been designed to be optimally suited for use in language engineering research and applications, in order to serve as a widely accepted set of encoding standards for European corpus work...The CES specifies a minimal encoding level that corpora must achieve to be considered standardized in terms of descriptive representation (marking of structural and typographic information) as well as general architecture (so as to be maximally suited for use in a text database). CES DTDs via dtd2html From here you can explore a navigable view (using dtd2html) of each dtd. It is dependent on the unix carriage return so it will probably need to be modified to work under dos. See the script Using Cyrillic Entities with Emacs psgml mode I have a system that lets you type the keys you would normally type to generate a character but when you are in psgml mode it generates the entitiy for this character, so you can type normaly and be inserting entities. It would work equally well for other character sets (ISOlat1 or 2), I just had a need for cyrillic so that is the one I set up. So if after looking at the HowTo you want the package, please send me email and we'll work out a way to get it to you (uuencoded mail probably). Other SGML projects and links Robin Cover's SGML web page. Other projects and links Text to Speech at speeds above 350wpm I have several scripts and emacs macros for working with a dectalk (multivoice) text to speech unit, nothing to fancy but if you are interestd in them, drop me a note. If you have some of your own, I would be interested in what you have come up with. Information on emacspeak and the mailing list is available at http://www.cs.vassar.edu/mirror/emacspeak/emacspeak.html . If you have any questions or comments about it, please send them to: priestdo@cs.vassar.edu No Soliciting!",
