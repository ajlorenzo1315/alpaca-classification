Running the Simulator The current version of the program simulates Round-Robin (RR) scheduling, but it is constructed to allow easy modification for other scheduling policies. data-file : Name of the file containing the trace data used in the simulation. quantum : Length of the time-slice used in Round-Robin scheduling. In this simulation, the devices available to a job are the CPU and the disk. There is also a clock device and a pseudo-device that interrupts whenever a new job arrives in the system. It queues Jobs that are waiting to use a device and will choose which job is the next to access. It sends them to a scheduler, takes the next job from a scheduler, and starts and stops jobs running on a device. For those who would like a more detailed description of the system (more than is necessary to do this assignment), you can either read the comments in the code itself, or click here . Because this is a simulation, you can ``cheat'' by looking at the burst length of a process when deciding which process to run next. In this algorithm, the currently-running process is the one with the least time left in its current burst. For your final version of the program, modify the SJF algorithm to use a predicted burst length. To implement PSJF you will have to modify the Job class to record a little more information. Copy all of these files into one of your directories and type make to run the Round-Robin version of the simulator. One useful Job method is: int nextBurst() which returns the burst time remaining Experiments Compare the performance of the four scheduling algorithms. Also compare the performance for various values of the parameters: quantum for RR and a for PSJF). You should approach this portion of the assignment as you would approach a laboratory assignment in a physics course. Report You are to prepare a report describing the results of your experiments. Handing In You should bring your report and all of the .java files you modified (with your additions clearly detailed in your code or in a separate file) to class on the day the project is due. You should also create four directories in your hand-in folder -- one for each of your scheduler versions.",
