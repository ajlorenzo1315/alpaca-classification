For example, I would use in \"\\\\Dawn\\ioi\". Q: How do I use Windows applications in Unix? A: You can use the \"windd\" command (/usr/local/bin/windd) to log on an NT machine. Type \"windd\" in an xterm and the windd desktop will come up. That will bring you to the NT login screen. Notice that WinDD runs Windows NT 3.51 only but most applications should work without problems. If you want to increase the size of the WinDD dekstop, try giving the -geometry option when you start windd. A: On Solaris: /opts/pure/bin/purify On SunOS:   /vol/pure/bin/purify ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The answers to the following topics will come up shortly. Q: How do I maintain binaries of different platforms in the same file system? E.g., I want to compile Tcl/Tk for both SunOS and Solaris, but now I need to do a \"make distclean; ./configure\" each time I want to compile binaries for a different platform. cd ~ioi/wdev and look at the directory structure. Q: What is purify? What alternatives can I use? Q: What is the Tcl/Tk Engineering Manual? Q: How do I develop a test suite for my Tcl/Tk applications? Q: Is there a quick example for CVS?",
