Martin (milo@cs.wisc.edu) Using Projects The first thing to do is to make sure that you have a directory \"u:\\programs\\prog6\\\". Also make sure that the \"u:\\programs\" is highlighted in the left pane. Then go to \"File->create directory\", and make a directory called \"prog6.\" If you want to work on program 6, you will have to make sure that you've opened the project file for program 6. To create this project, we follow these steps: Go to \"Project->new project\". This should bring up a dialog box. In this dialog box, for \"Project Path and Name,\" we will fill in \"u:\\programs\\prog6\\prog6.ide.\" Then click on the button \"Advanced\". This should bring up another dialog box. In this dialog box, make sure that the \"initial node\" is \".cpp\", and that .rc and .def are not checked. click okay to close this dialog. This should return us to the other dialog. Click okay to close this dialog. We should now be in Borland, and there should be a new window with the title \"project\" that has something like this in it: [ ] prog6.exe [.exe] ..... | - prog6.cpp [.cpp] This tells us that the project wants to make the program \"prog6.exe\", and it knows that \"prog6.cpp\" is used to make that program. We want to add one more file to this project. First, click on \"prog6.exe\" to make sure it is highlighted. This should bring up a dialog. Go to \"u:\\programs\\prog6\\\" and enter \"Appointment.cpp\", and click okay. You should not add header (.h) files to this list. That should be it.",
