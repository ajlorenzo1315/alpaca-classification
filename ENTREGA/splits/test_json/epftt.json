    "Cuerpo": "We think that many people in the department would like to give -- we will help by providing a list of needs and collecting and delivering donations. It would be great if our department can make a difference in the lives of some less fortunate Madison residents! We encourage all faculty, staff, graduates and undergraduates to participate. The Dane County Advocates for Battered Women serves to house battered women and their children, the Middleton Outreach Ministry feeds needy families, the Off the Square Club benefits mentally ill adults, and the Respite Center provides crisis child care. In addition, we've listed the American Red Cross who is always in need of blood donations. Please leave donations in the holiday box in the 6th floor lounge (room 6331) by December 21st. If you prefer to give a cash donation, just drop a check made out to 'SACM' in the SACM mailbox and mark it 'Holiday Fund.' Happy Holidays! This shelter is filled to capacity almost every night. It needs everything a very large household requires.
