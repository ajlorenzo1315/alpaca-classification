    "Cuerpo": "He's been shot at, insulted, abandoned for billions of years, then grabbed to go back in time to where he started the whole wait from, now in a ship plunging straight into the heart of a sun...the only escape is a teleporter tube. Fortunately, Marvin (as he's fond of telling people) has the brains the size of a planet and can repair the teleporter if he can only get ahold of some spare parts. For the moment, we'll only be designing the backbone for it, so some of the elements mentioned above won't be incorporated until a later assignment(for example, you'll note below there's no mention of spare parts...for this program, we'll have the tube working fine to begin with and no spare parts at all) Due Date: Monday 10/1/96, 5:00 pm GRADE: 3% of your final grade. Marvin can move N (North), W(West), S(South), and E(East). If you enter an illegal move (either a bad command, or trying to move Marvin through the wall), no time unit is charged. If Marvin fails to reach the teleporter in 25 moves, he's fried. Here's a sample of my output: Marvin is at 1    1 Marvin has made 0 moves out of 25 What's Marvin's next move? Marvin is at 1    2 Marvin has made 1 moves out of 25 What's Marvin's next move? (N,S,E,W,Q) 's' Illegal Command What's Marvin's next move? Marvin is at 2    2 Marvin has made 2 moves out of 25 What's Marvin's next move? (N,S,E,W,Q) Feel free to spice up the output anyway you like, so long as the following are included: Horizontal and Verticlal coordinates of Marvin. We may be modifying the program for a future assignment, so it'll be easier to change these values here than having to go search for them several times within the program itself. What I want to see as parameters are: coordinates of the teleporter tube. number of time units that pass for each step Marvin takes. In the future, we may be loading in from disk some mazes for Marvin to move around, so he won't always start off at (1,1), nor will the tube always be at (5,5)...for that matter, our room can be a different size for each maze, and we can vary the time limit if we want. DO NOT USE GOTOS! Important - Make sure you copy the correct versions of your program files because these are what will be graded. You also have to hand in a printed copy of your FORTRAN source code file. Note that you will be graded on correct output for the cases given below, so before handing it in you must run your program for the following cases  and manually check that your program gives the correct results in every case. In addition, 25 points (half of the total points for this assignment) will be taken off if you use GOTOs.",
