Shadows are powerful perceptual cues for the 3D relationship of objects in a scene. The DX renderer does not produce shadows, but is possible to generate acceptable shadows by modifying the colors of individual vertices of objects in a scene. The macro described here performs the following steps: The obects to be shadowed are transformed to the coordinate system of a light places in an arbitrary direction at infinity. A depth buffer is calculated from the viewpoint of the light. The depth buffer is turned into a \"volume\" data set by stacking it with itself in such a way that it overlaps all the vertices in the original objects. The volume depth buffer is mapped onto the original vertices as new data. The depth buffer value at each vertex is compared to the depth at of the vertex. If the vertex is farther from the light than the value given by the depth buffer, it is dimmed. The Compute module cannot resolve transform objects. It runs well on a machine with .5 Gbyte of memory. Explaination of inputs: The object input carries the objects to be shadowed against each other. The depth_resolution input is the resolution of the desired depth-buffer. The shadow_factor is the amount to \"dim\" a shadowed vertex. The offset input allows the objects to move along the z-axis of the light. You also need it's configuration file from here. The test program layout is shown here. An example output from the program is shown below. To download the macro click here. (Last updated November 7, 1994 by Bruce Land)",
