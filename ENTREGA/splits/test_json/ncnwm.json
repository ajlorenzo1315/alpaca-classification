Since F = m*a where a is the acceleration, a =  -(k/m)*x Now given the acceleration, and if we know an initial velocity and position, we can find the position of the mass at any later time. In the case of this linear spring, we can integrate the acceleration directly to find that the position is a sinusoidal function of time. We will start with a integration scheme which will be used only for intrducing the notion of numerical integration. We want to start with a differential equation and show how to integrate in numerically. Rearranging this equation yields: which gives a explicit form for stepping the system from time n-1 to time n. This form is thus a way to step a dynamic system forward in time given an initial state x0. This algorithm is most useful for second order systems where the force on an object is specified and the position is desired as a function of time. Where are the accelerations calculated from a force law describing the system and which are usually a function of position. Gravitation and the three-body problem The accleration due to a gravitating mass is where G is a strength contant, M is the mass of the object pulling on you, and r is the distance between you and M. Since a and r are actually vectors we must derive a form of this equation which is useful in 2 or 3 dimensions. We will use 2D here so we need equations for the x and y components of the acceleration. Converting to  a Cartesian form the acceleration of body one is: where the vectors The calculation procedure for each time step is to compute: the acceleration, a, based on the positions at time n-1 a new set of positions using the Verlet method the acceleration at time n based on the newly computed positions a new velocity from the Verlet method using the acclerations at times n-1 and n. For the gravitational animation given at the beginning of this page, three masses were simulated. First note that the partial with respect to time is the acceleration of a small surface element of water, so that if the right side of the equation can be put in a discrete form we can apply the Verlet method to a 2D grid of \"bodies\", each representing a small chunk of water. The discrete spatial approximation is that the second derivitives (at time n) are were i and j are the grid indices in the x and y directions and n is the time index. So the depth at time n is given by To get the surface motion, first assign an initial height and vertical velocity to each grid point (i,j) then at each time step compute : the acceleration, a, based on the water heights at time n-1 a new set of positions using the Verlet method for each (i,j) the acceleration at time n based on the newly computed heights a new velocity from the Verlet method for each (i,j) Ensure conservation of volume of the total volume by adjusting the average water height to a constant. Billards A billards, hard ball, system is different than the other two systems just described because the forces between balls are zero until they touch and become very large if the balls try to pass through each other. The Verlet integration scheme will fail badly on this system because the accelerations are large for a short time and thus not smooth enough to average. The change in velocity during impact can be derived for frictionless balls of  equal mass by noting that the the impact force must act in a direction parallel to the line connecting the centers of the two impacting balls. If i and j are the indices of the colliding balls define: then delta v for ball i is given by the following where the right-most term represents the projection of the velocity onto the line and the other term converts the projection back to x,y coordinates. The time step needs to be small enough so that the balls do not penetrate each other too much during one time step.",
