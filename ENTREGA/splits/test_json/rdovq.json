Dale Anchir Angel Syang Debra Lynn Burton Cheng- Chih Wu Vicki Lynn Almstrum Youngju Kim A Quantitative Student Model for Intelligent Tutoring Systems: Student Programming Ability, Anchir Angel Syang , 1994. The purpose of this research was to develop a quantitative model to measure programming abilities of students who have completed the first course in computer science. This model could then be used as the student model in an intelligent tutoring system. Performance data was based on the responses of 315 students to 50 questions covering the programming concepts of CS1  The course grade prior to the final exam was used as the basis for comparing the different models. The results showed that the model proposed in the study is feasible and could be used to develop a computerized adaptive test based on item response theory. Such a test could form the basis for a student model in an intelligent tutoring system for computer programming. The Effect of Closed Laboratory Activities on the Comprehension of Five Concepts and the Perception of Effectiveness of the Course in a Second Semester Computer Science Course, Debra Lynn Burton , 1992. The experiment was conducted in CS2 classes where there were large lecture sections and smaller weekly discussion sections. The results showed no significant difference in the comprehension of the five concepts between the students who participated in the closed laboratory activities and those students who did paper and pencil exercises. Most novice students have trouble learning recursion. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the method of presentation (concrete or abstract) affected how students learned recursion and to determine the role played by the students' own learning styles. Each student took the Kolb Learning Styles Inventory, which categorizes the student's cognitive learning style as concrete or abstract. Two models of presenting recursion were devised, one concrete and one abstract. This study sought objective evidence that computer science students have more difficulty understanding concepts in the subdomain of mathematical logic than they do in other areas of computer science. The data used for the study were the multiple-choice questions of five Advanced Placement Examinations in Computer Science. There were two main parts to this study:  determining which questions related to logic and comparing student performance on those questions related to logic and those questions with little or no relationship to logic. The results of the content analysis were used to partition the questions into those strongly related  to logic and those not strongly related to logic. The Reasoning Ability and Achievement of College Level Students Enrolled in a Logic Class in Computer Science, Youngju Kim , 1995. This research considered the following questions: What is the relationship between a student's score on the PLT and his or her achievement in a logic class and does taking a logic class improve a student's score on the PLT? The PLT was given on the first and last days of class in a logic course designed for computer science majors.",
