Here are some I'm especially happy with and links to other miscellaneous on-line stuff of mine. The Emily Dickinson home page including an archive of a discussion list and links to over 370 of her poems on-line . I led a group consisting of most of my OO class in building a hypertext OSA Tutorial . There are links to on-line quizes , but the quiz program is currently (21Mar96) not working. As an experiment in HTML graphics and interfaces, I designed some pages to resemble control panels on the Enterprise .",
