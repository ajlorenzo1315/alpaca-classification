    "Cuerpo": "This is done in a way that provides fault-tolerance, although it is limited to certain classes of reasonably benign failures. My effort has a theoretical and a practical side. The practical work started in 1985, when we developed a computing system called the Isis Toolkit. We are now developing a new system, Horus, which is intended to be more flexible than Isis and which addresses issues such as real-time communication and security. On the more fundamental side of the effort, the Horus group is looking at techniques for specifying and proving properties of process-group structured systems. We are also studying extensions of the virtual synchrony model, notably in work by Roy Friedman on adding real-time guarantees to Horus and in work by Mark Hayden on support for probabilistic broadcast primitives and programming tools. Horus is very much a collaboration. The architecture and development side of the effort is headed by Dr.  Robbert van Renesse, Werner Vogels and Roy Friedman. Six graduate students are working on aspects of the system, including the development of object-oriented programming tools for multimedia communication applications, security and privacy, high-speed protocols that exploit ATM, and other problems.
