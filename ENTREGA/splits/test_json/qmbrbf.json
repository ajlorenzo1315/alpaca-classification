It introduces the Object Management Group (OMG) Core Object Model, the OMG Reference Model, the standardization procedures, the proposal procedures, and specification guidelines of OMG. The OMG Reference Model consists of the four layers:  the Object Request Broker (ORB), CORBAservices, CORBAfacilities, and Application Objects of which the first three are described in detail in their own specification texts. Object Management Group. It provides background history on OMG, summarizes the information in the defining specifications on CORBA (first four entries of this bibliography), and presents an Interface Definition Language (IDL) and C++ coding example using SunSoft's NEO CORBA environment. \"Distributed Object Computing with CORBA.\" USENIX Asso., Berkeley, CA, pp. Although CORBA is meant for distributed systems, one shortfall is its lack of dealing with fault-tolerance, which could be implemented in software as groups of replicated objects that utilize reliable multicast communication. Recognizing this limitation, the author presents and discusses Electra -- \"the best of both worlds,\" a generic object request broker (ORB) that adds the reliable group multicast capabilities of systems such as Horus and Isis to a CORBA implementation. Schmidt, D. C., Harrison, T., and Al-Shaer, E.  \"Object-Oriented Components for High-speed Network Programming.\" USENIX Asso., Berkeley, CA, pp. \"Middleware:  A Model for Distributed System Services.\" This is second in a series of columns on distributed object computing (DOC). The paper includes a clear diagram showing the OMG Reference Model and depicting specified and yet to be specified CORBA components. CORBA.\" Microsoft's Component Object Model (COM) is the defining object model for the popular Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) for desktop applications. OMG has completed the COM-CORBA interoperability specification; however, distributed COM, contained in Network OLE (see next entry), is still being defined and may pose a greater challenge for interoperability specification between the two. Network Object Linking and Embedding (Network OLE) from Microsoft and CORBA 2.0 from the Object Management Group are compared. -->Table of Contents Real-World CORBA Applications Pompeii, John.
