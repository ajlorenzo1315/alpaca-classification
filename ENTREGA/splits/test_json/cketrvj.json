I'm new to UW, having arrived this summer from Illinois College . Founded in 1829, IC was the first college in the state to grant a degree. Perhaps its best-known graduate was William Jennings Bryan. Before that, I was at Arizona State University in Tempe, AZ, doing a Ph.D. My dissertation was about neural network speech recognition. Before drifting into ASU's graduate program, I had worked for Honeywell for 11 years, first in Washington D.C. and then in Phoenix . For most of the Honeywell years in Phoenix, I was an operating systems developer. The District of Columbia was the most interesting place I've ever lived (outside of a summer in Munich) until coming to Seattle (unless you count that year in New York which I never tell people about and which cannot be detected from my resume). In fact, from the windows of my junior high school classrooms I could see buildings of the KSU campus. As you might deduce, I'm old enough to remember 3-cent stamps, 48-star flags, the Hungarian uprising, and Sputnik. Aside from computers and languages, music has played a big part in my life. Even before moving to Seattle I had made four trips to Seattle to see and hear Wagner 's epic Der Ring des Nibelungen (plus three trips for other reasons). Since those visits have usually been in July or August, I have developed the firm impression that Seattle has a delightful Mediterranean climate not unlike Nice or San Diego. More about GCOS-8 (the OS) and DPS-8 (the hardware architecture). Each native process sees memory as a variable set of unforgeable \"descriptors\" which give access to protected virtual address spaces ranging in size from one byte to many megabytes. There were many other noteworthy innovations in the system, many of them going all the way  to the predecessor non-virtual system of the late 1960's: GCOS-III, which started life as GECOS. Among many features that can be traced back to GCOS-III (or earlier?) are: support for symmetric multiprocessing (up to eight CPUs); databases (the CODASYL network database model derived from a Honeywell product); on-line support (time-sharing and transaction systems which both which ran rings around the analogous IBM products); a secure and flexible file system, etc. Of course, one can find blemishes and limitations, too, especially with the benefit of hindsight. Shortly after I left Honeywell, the company spun off its computer division into an independent corporation that was owned jointly by Honeywell, NEC, and Bull (France), all of whom had historic ties to or vested interests in various of Honeywell's computer products.",
