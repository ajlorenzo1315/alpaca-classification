    "Título": "C241 Course Description",
    "Cuerpo": "It is the aim of this course to present many of the mathematical topics that are frequently encountered while learning computer science. We start by examining in more detail the concept of recursion in Chapter 2 entitled \"Iteration, Induction, and Recursion.\" In preparation for study in the analysis of algorithms, we shall look at the big-Oh notation in Chapter 3. The same is true in computer science, and we next go to Chapter 5 to discuss special graphs, called trees, as they are used as a data model in computing. This material is is contained in Chapter 10. This text is designed for a year-long course which introduces students not only to the fundamental ideas underlying computer science but also to the important data structures used in computing. It would be nice to have enough time during the semester to cover the whole text, but since this is not the case, and since the material that we skip is so interesting, you might consider reading some of the sections or chapters we skip to get a head start for some of the future courses. Homework assignments will be posted to the class web page regularly, usually due the next discussion section. Please write your solutions to the problems in a way that will be easy for the graders to read and understand. In this course, you may discuss assignments with other students. If you are working with a group, please indicate it on your homework papers. Announcements Exam 2--Wed, Nov 13 Oct. 23 Oct. 3 Sept. 30 Sept. 17 Sept. 16 Sept. 13 Form of HW Sept. 5 Handouts Template for strong mathematical induction. Solutions Due Mon 9 at the beginning of class. Solutions Due Wed 4 by the end of the day.

You are also encouraged to use it to post questions related to the course or share related information with the rest of the class. It will be updated with additional information, such as homework assignments, as the course progresses. The URL for the computer science department's home page is http://www.cs.indiana.edu/ , from which all sorts of information can be obtained, including a thread to this home page. Grading 40% Homework assignments and quizzes. is the last day (until 4:00pm) to drop a course or withdraw from all courses with an automatic W.  After that date, a student may withdraw only with the permission of his or her dean.",
