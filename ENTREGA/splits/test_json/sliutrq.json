How to use FORTRAN on the PC's Click here Compiling Steps Source Program (.for) in Fortran sent to compiler Compiler translates Fortran into \"machine language with a couple of holes left\",spits out .obj file A program may be broken into lots of segments, so there may be other obj's around. .obj files all read in, spits out .exe file (runnable machine language). Must put things in memory in order to run it. Memory and Binary (to the tune of \"Ebony and Ivory\"...just kidding) Each cell of memory (called a bit) either has a charge or has no charge. Since each bit can be one of 2 things, 2 bits can be one of 4 things (00,01,10,11),3 bits can be one of 8 things (000,001,010,011,100,101,110,111), i.e. 2^n. This is because each digit can be one of 10 things (just as binary in the example above uses powers of 2). Take 1101, for example. in BINARY, 1101 is 1x2^3 + 1x2^2 + 1x2^0 = 8+4+1 = 13. For example, 1101 might stand for \"add\". So 1101 0001 0011 0010 might mean \"add whatever's in memory location 0001 to whatever's in 0011 and store the result in memory location 0010\" (note the last three sets of digits refer to memory locations). You can't actually add to and from memory locations, so this is not quite a real example, but it gives you an idea of what's going on. Machine code is very hard to read. This is just to show how tedious things were in Assembly Language). A register is a place where you do computations. So in order to compute you have to grab values from memory, stick them on registers, add the two registers into a third register, then store it back into memory somewhere else. This is a Fortran statement which is  translated (compiled) into those assembly instructions you see above. You don't have to worry about where in memory SUM,TERM1,and TERM2 are located...the compiler takes care of that for you.",
