These, together with convergence of image creation, analysis and representation techniques, are leading to new developments in multimedia production and services. The access to digitised image, sound and data from the workplace and from the home relies on increasingly smarter bearer services. Fast retrieval of essential information and browsing ever increasing amounts of information require smart intelligent guides, software and agents, as well as multimodal interfaces. This third issue of the IMAGE'COM is co-located with the first ECMAST (European Conference on Multimedia Applications, Systems and Technologies) to provide a forum to monitor and anticipate the developments that make multimedia applications possible, to exchange information and results on recent work, and to help cross-fertilisation of image and communication research activities.
