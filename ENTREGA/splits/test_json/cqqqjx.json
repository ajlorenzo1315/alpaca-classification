The goal of this work is to provide a layer to Horus which will interact with The Kerberos Network Authentication Service and other cryptographic tools in order to provide privacy and authentication services to processes in a group setting. The original security architecture for Horus was implemented by Mike Reiter (see A Security Architecture for Fault-Tolerant Systems ). In order to maintain virtual synchrony (in the crash failure model used in Horus ), it is necessary for all processes within a group to be honest. As a result, the original security architecture makes the assumption that any process which is allowed to join a group is trusted by all of the group members. In such groups, it may be desirable to permit untrusted processes to join. The new Horus security architecture will permit arbitrary trust relationships among the processes within a group. Using this scheme, a process group may trivially achieve the semantics provided by the original security architecture (however with a slightly higher overhead). However, unlike the original security architecture, the new architecture enables the implementation of groups (such as client/server groups) which many have more complicated trust relationships among group members. Thesis Research In my thesis, I proposed a set of solutions to the privacy problems inherent in mobile networks. In a static network, there are two basic types of information which users may wish to keep private. The first is the contents of the messages that they send to other users. In a mobile network, in addition to the types of information in a static network, there is also location information. However, the messages that their devices send and receive may reveal private information about the devices' owners. In my research, I developed, along with my advisor Ken Birman , a set of protocols to prevent such attacks from both internal and external adversaries.
