As a result, we can solve our logic module minimization problem optimally by solving the linear relaxation of the integer program. Contact: yaoping@cs.utexas.edu Honghua Yang and D. F. Wong. We consider the problem of performance driven lookup-table (LUT) based technology mapping for FPGAs using a general delay model. In the general delay model, each interconnection edge has a weight representing the delay of the interconnection. Well known technology mappers such as FlowMap and Chortle-d only minimize the number of levels in the technology mapped circuit and hence are not suitable for such an iterative re-technology mapping process. Recently, Mathur and Liu  studied the performance driven technology mapping problem using the general delay model and presented an effective heuristic algorithm for the problem. In this paper, we present an efficient technology mapping algorithm that achieves provably optimal delay in the technology mapped circuit using the general delay model. A key problem in our algorithm is to compute a K-feasible network cut such that the circuit delay on every cut edge is upper-bounded by a specific value. In this paper, we consider the problem of simultaneously performing functional-unit binding and floorplanning. Delay Minimal Decomposition of Multiplexers in Technology Mapping International Workshop on Logic Synthesis, May 1995. In this paper, we give an algorithm for optimally decomposing multiplexers, so as to minimize the delay of the network. We present the results of mapping networks, decomposed by such a scheme, to Actel2 and lsi_10K libraries, which are rich in multiplexers. Experimental results indicate that the quality of the mapped circuits, measured in terms of area, delay, and routability, is greatly improved, when compared to a Huffman tree based AND-OR decomposition scheme. Simultaneous Area and Delay Minimum K-LUT Mapping for K-Exact Networks International Conference on Computer Design, October 1995. The corresponding delay minimization problem (under the constant delay model) was solved in polynomial time by the flow-map algorithm, for arbitrary values of K. We study the class of K-bounded networks, where all nodes have exactly K inputs. This leads to a polynomial time algorithm for computing the simultaneous area and delay minimum mapping for such networks using K-input lookup tables. We also show that the flow-map algorithm minimizes the area of the mapped network as well, for K-exact networks. We then show that for K=2 the mapping solution for a 2-bounded network, minimizing the area and delay simultaneously, can be easily obtained from that of a 2-exact network derived from it by eliminating single input nodes.",
