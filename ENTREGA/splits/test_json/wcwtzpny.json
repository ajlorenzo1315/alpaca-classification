    "Cuerpo": "This project  focuses on the study of scheduling algorithms for exploiting data, task and loop parallelism, and the development of  run-time support on message-passing architectures. We are developing a run-time system called RAPID which integrates automatic scheduling techniques and efficient communication schemes for  irregular task computations with mixed granularities on message-passing distributed memory machines. Our experimental results on Cray T3D and Meiko CS-2 indicate that the system obtains promising performance in sparse matrix problems for which actual speedups have been hard to obtain in the literature. In particular, using the RAPID system we have obtained good performance for parallel sparse LU/Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting, which is an open parallelization problem in scientific computing literature.
