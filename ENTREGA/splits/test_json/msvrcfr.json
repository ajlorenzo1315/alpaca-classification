Relationship between Lecture and Lab In the lecture, we shall cover basic concepts and methods of programming and problem solving. In the lab, you will work on concrete problems and learn to apply the concepts of the lecture. You will also be given an assignment to complete. This assignment will be due at the beginning of your next lab session. You may have time during the lab to work on your assignment. We will be using the Borland Turbo C++ compiler, which is available at several UCS sites . It is available at the IU Bookstore for roughly $50.00 (this is including the student discount). All assignments must compile and run using the version of Turbo C++ on the UCS machines. The final exam is also closed-book and is cumulative. No exceptions will be made. You must pass the final exam in order to pass this course. Grading Final grades will be determined according to the following: Exam 1 15% Exam 2 15% Final 20% Practical 1 10% Practical 2 15% Lab Assignments 25% All grades will be kept online .
