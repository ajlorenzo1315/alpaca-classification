In this paper, we focus on the goals, problems and approach taken in geoPOM towards defining the spatial functionality of the heterogeneous geoscientific object system available to the user, as well as, the mapping of the spatial object model to the diverse semantic and functional characteristics of the heterogeneous spatial data repositories. In this article we illustrate the use of OASIS for exploratory data analysis and data mining of spatio-temporal phenomena from large geophysical datasets. Muntz, E. Mesrobian, and K. Ng, \"Scalable Exploratory Data Mining of Distributed Geoscientific Data\" , Second International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining , Portland, Oregon, Aug. 1996. In this paper, we discuss how database query processing and distributed object management techniques can be used to facilitate geoscientific data mining and analysis. Shek, E. Mesrobian, and R.R. In this paper, we present an overview of the Conquest parallel scientific query processing system that we are developing at UCLA to tackle some of the scientific data management problems presented by the proliferation of geographic applications, data formats, and storage systems, as well as the complexity of data and the computational requirements of scientific queries.

Krieger, \"OASIS: An Open Architecture Scientific Information System\", Science Information Systems Interoperability Conference , College Park, MD, Nov. 1995. The important scientific challenge of understanding global climate change is one that clearly requires the application of knowledge discovery and data mining techniques on a massive scale. We present here early experiences with a prototype exploratory data analysis environment, CONQUEST, designed to provide content-based access to such massive scientific datasets. Muntz, E. Mesrobian, C.R. In this paper we present the Conquest environment and illustrate its use for exploratory data analysis and data mining of spatio-temporal phenomena from geophysical datasets. Each of these applications is a potential client of model output data. In addition to providing a flexible data model to serve as the canonical model for a wide variety of scientific and non-scientific data, it is important for a system to be able to efficiently retrieve and operate on scientific data. Examples are presented of the use of QUEST for the content-based access of Global Circulation Model (GCM) datasets. Farrara, and P. Stolorz, \"Extracting Spatio-Temporal Patterns from Geoscience Datasets\" , IEEE Workshop on Visualization and Machine Vision, Seattle, WA, Jun 1994. QUEST employs workstations as well as teraFLOP computers to analyze geoscience data to produce spatial-temporal features that can be used as high-level indexes.",
