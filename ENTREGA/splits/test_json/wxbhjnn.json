If you want to save yourself some typing, you can click here and then go to the \"File\" menu on Netscape and do a \"Save as...\". The Program: ******************************************************************************* This program computes the gross wages, income taxes, and net wages for an employee when given the pay rate and number of hours worked. main() { int hours;\t\t// number of hours worked in the week float payRate;\t\t// rate of pay in dollars per hour float taxRate;\t\t// income tax rate float netWages;\t\t// net pay for the week (pre-tax) float taxes;\t\t// amount paid in income tax float grossWages;\t// gross pay for the week (post-tax) cout << \"Enter the hourly rate of pay: $\"; cin >> payRate; // print out the net wages, taxes, and gross wages cout << \"Net wages: \" << netWages << \"\\n\"; cout << \"Taxes: \" << taxes << \"\\n\"; cout << \"Gross wages: \" << grossWages << \"\\n\"; } ******************************************************************************* Borland C++ 4.5 Hints Log into your account, and start Borland C++ 4.5 which is found in the CSApps program group. When you have Borland up and running, you want to first create a file to write your program in. The first time you save it, choose Save as within the File menu. This will ask you to name the file. Remember, since this will be a program file, the name must end with .cpp . The second time you save, you can just choose Save , and it will be done automatically. Once you have the program typed into the file window, and you have saved the program in case something unsavory happens, then you just need to press the little lightening bolt button near the top of the screen. Your program will be compiled, linked, and run. When the program runs, it will create a window, and prompt you to enter a number of hours worked and an hourly rate of pay. Turning in the assignment When you turn in programs, I am going to want you to bring a printed copy of the program to me at the beginning of class on the day it is due. To print a copy of the program, go back to the File menu, and choose Print . To hand in an electronic copy of the program, you must use the File Manager program in the Main group. You are to drop your program0.cpp file into the folder with your name. Even though this program is not graded, it is important that you turn the electronic as well as a printed copy of the assignment in to me correctly (so I can make sure there are no problems).",
