General announcements will be made in the cs367 home page, and changes or problems with a particular program will be put on its page. However, there will be times when you will need face-to-face help to resolve a programming problem, to understand the course material, or other reasons. You may stop by either TA's office or my office during the hours posted in the CS367 home page. If you can not stop by during the scheduled office hours you can also make an appointment. Put the word appointment in the subject line. A reply will be sent and arrangements will be made for an appointment. Guidelines for TAs/Lecturer Office Hours Please follow these guidelines when visiting the TAs or the lecturer during office hours. Problems compiling your program: If you are unable to compile your program, then you may have a syntax error or a problem with your compiler commands/makefile. It is vital that you bring in a printout or write down the complete error, and a printout of your current program and makefile. Also mark in your source code printout the line where the error is occuring. Problems running your program: If the program compiles but does not run correctly, you should try tracing your program manually or by using the debugger. We will ask what you have determined using these techniques, and will ask you for a test case that consistently demonstrates your error. Bring in a printout of your current source code and any error messages. Other problems developing your program: Please make certain to read the on-line information prior to visiting. When office hours are busy, a priority system may be used. See the lecturer for all exam grading questions. See the appropriate grader for all program grading questions. If you have further questions or are not satisfied by the graders response, then see the lecturer. Copyright © 1996 James D. Skrentny, skrentny@cs.wisc.edu",
