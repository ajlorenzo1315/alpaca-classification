Various suggestions have been made; it is turning out to be the case that most are reducible to probabilistic measures. Purely subjective views of probability are of questionable use; but objective logical views are not yet well developed. That is a task we are currently working on. Not only do we want to represent uncertainty in a fixed body of knowledge, but we want to use new evidence to update those probabilities. Analysis reveals that they have much in common, but efficient updating is still a goal we are working on. Finally, the reason for the intelligent use of uncertainty is for making decisions. But the appropriate decision theory depends on the treatment of uncertainty, and so is also an active area of research. Click here for my research group's home page. Kyburg, H.
