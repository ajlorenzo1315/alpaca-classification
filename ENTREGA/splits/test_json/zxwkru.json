    "Cuerpo": "The first EYH conference was held at Cornell in 1987 and involved about 50 girls and their parents. Why EYH? The Text The Data The Doonesbury Cartoons How does EYH work? From the 1993 recruiting brochure: What's this Expanding Your Horizons Conference about? It's an opportunity for girls in grades 6-8 and their parents to learn about careers that use mathematics and science. You get information straight from the source. or \"What was your favorite class in high school?\" You have a chance to perform scientific experiments, work with computers, study barnyard animals and lots of other great stuff. And what is really great is that you get to choose which workshops you want to go to (and we'll do our best to make it so). Each will have cool science, mathematics or engineering activities, and women who are real scientists, engineers or mathematicians! What do I get? You get: a fun day filled with great hands-on science, engineering and mathematics activities, a folder full of interesting materials about mathematics, engineering and science, lunch, a T-shirt and a science toy. What do the accompanying adults get to do? There will be special workshops for the adults to show them how to help you explore mathematics, science, and engineering. If they have any questions about careers for women in mathematics, science, and engineering, there will be plenty of professional women to offer answers. The adults will get to go with you to one or two workshops and see all the cool stuff you are doing. Computer Science Workshop The Computer Science workshop is called \"Image Processing\". We use a program called \"popi\" to manipulate pictures of the girls. Click here for our handout on Image Processing. Click here for some manipulated pictures.",
