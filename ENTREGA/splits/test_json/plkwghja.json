The Scenario: For the Smalltalk part of the class we will be looking at banks and bank accounts again. We will define these classes: Account ---an account will have a number , a balance and a list of transactions . For this cut at the code we will do very primitive output:  we will create a window for each account and let it display its transactions to its own window. Therefore the account class will have the following instance variables: number , balance , transactions , and displayer . (We will talk in class about instance variables and class variables. The methods for an account will be the following: number Answer the account's number. deposit: anAmount on: aDate Add the (numeric) argument anAmount to the account's balance. withdraw: anAmount on: aDate Deduct the (numeric) argument anAmount from the account's balance, and add the transaction to the account's transaction list. Transaction ---this class will store the amount of the transaction (deposit or withdrawal) and the date on which it occurred. Its instance variables will therefore be amount and date . On the next page you will find code for the Transaction and Account classes. ======================================== This code defines the Transaction class ======================================== newAmount: anAmount date: aDate \"Answer an instance of a transaction object with the specified date and amount. ^self new initializeAmount: anAmount date: aDate. ======================================== This code defines the Account class ======================================== new \"Answer a new instance of Account with next number, balance 0, and empty transactions.\" initialize \"To initialize the Account class we set the next account number to 1.\" initialize \"To initialize an instance of Account, we initialize the instance variables and open a window to display the transactions.\" deposit: anAmount on: aDate \"To deposit, adjust the balance, and make up a new transaction object with the specified amount and date.\"",
