Netscape The most important item. If you are reading this, you probably now something about using the World Wide Web. I will put a lot of information on these pages. The things you should remember about Netscape are: Underlined text are links to other pages. When on an important page (like our homepage), go to ``Bookmarks'' and select ``Add Bookmark''. From that point on, that page will appear as a menu item under ``Bookmarks.'' To print a page, use the ``File'' menu, and select ``Print.'' Avoid printing if you can--you have a quota of 300 pages for the semester. (Email lab@cs.wisc.edu for details.) BTW, the printer room is across the hall. Microsoft Windows Windows is the operating system running on our computers. It is supposed to be intuitive, but if you're new, you may want to read this introduction. If Program 0 is too brief, you should read this. You may want to read it anyway. Most of these resources are reached from the general home page for CS 302 . Good luck!
