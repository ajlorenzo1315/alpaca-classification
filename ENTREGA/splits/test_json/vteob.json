The first is to K.I.S.S. Think about your audience Most audiences should be addressed in layers: some are experts in your sub-area, some are experts in the general area, and others know little or nothing. Who is most important to you? Think about your rhetorical goals I recommend two goals for conference talks: leave your audience with a clear picture of the gist of your contribution, and make them want to read your paper. Thus, it is commonly useful to allude to information in the paper that can't be covered adequately in the presentation.

Thou shalt not practice Why waste research time practicing a talk? If you do practice, argue with any suggestions you get and make sure your talk is longer than the time you have to present it.",
