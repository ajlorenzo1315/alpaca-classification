    "Cuerpo": "Also, suppose we wish to put some of these elements into a list L. Our list L is a k-permutation of the set S if a) L has size k b) every element in L is distinct. A 3-permutation of S is a 3 digit number where no two digits are the same (345 for example). 344, however, would not be a permutation, since the last two digits are the same. The mathematical formula for the number of k-permutations when S is size n is n * (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) * ... * (n-k+1) a) Write a DO/END DO (not a WHILE loop) to calculate this number. END DO Note that this goes to K-1 because (N-K+1) = (N-(K-1)), so I must start at 0 and end at K-1. b) Write a DO WHILE/END DO loop to do the same. I'll just do the parallel DO WHILE loop to the first example in pt a): ANSWER = 1 PRINT *,'BLASTOFF!' PRINT *,'Bill Clinton' PRINT *,'Whew! END IF These should all be .LE. Otherwise, for anyone older or equal to 4, (AGE .GE. PRINT *,'Enter a zero' PRINT *,'Good, you entered a zero' The loop will run only while .NOT. DONE is .TRUE., i.e. only while DONE is .FALSE., so DONE must be set to .FALSE., not set to .TRUE., at the top of the program. So the value from the main program is used, hence it is an input argument. b) Output arguments only DONE The value of DONE is never used (i.e. found on the right hand side of an expression), so no old value from the main program is used, so this is not an input argument. DONE is, however, assigned to, so that value gets passed out of the function, back to the main program, hence it's an output argument. c) Both input and output arguments VALUE The old value of VALUE is used on the right hand side of VALUE = VALUE + 1 (i.e. the value of VALUE from the main program).
