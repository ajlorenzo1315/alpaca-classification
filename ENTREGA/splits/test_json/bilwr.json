Nov. 6, in class You are to work together as teams on Homework 4. Then meet together and formulate solutions to each if you can, and assign the writeup to one or more team members. For problems involving Verilog code, hand in your code and your simulation log (or at least part of it if it's really long). [Leiserson 29.2-1] [Leiserson 29.2-2] Let's say we have a set of N clients requesting service at the same time, only one of which we can service. We can use a round-robin approach to decide who next gets serviced. The N clients are put in some order, C_1 to C_N, and two bits are associated with each client. When choosing the next client to service, we start at the last client serviced and find the next requesting client. Design a circuit based on parallel-prefix to implement the round-robin protocol. Define your operator, show that it is associative, and sketch the resulting circuit. Extra credit: Can you solve this problem if we place the clients in a circle, with no start or end, instead of a list? Show that the conditional sum operator defined in class is associative. Write a verilog program for this adder and simulate it to show that it works correctly. Show that the delay of the carry-select adder is O(N^1/2). Simulate your circuit and show that it works correctly. Design a fast accumulator circuit which adds up a list of 8-bit numbers presented sequentially, one per clock cycle. Start is asserted on the cycle that a new list of numbers starts. Valid is asserted on the cycle that the sum of the last list of numbers is valid. Implement your circuit using Verilog using the unit-delay model to model the circuit delays. Simulate your circuit, showing how fast it is and that it works. ebeling@cs.washington.edu",
