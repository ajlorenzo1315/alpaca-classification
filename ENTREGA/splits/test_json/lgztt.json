Here's the view from my office (or would be if those danged buildings weren't in the way): Future Plans I plan to graduate in summer, 1996, after which I'll be joining DEC's Western Research Laboratory in sunny Palo Alto . We've just bought a house in nearby Menlo Park . Here is my curriculum vita ( postscript ). I also have a summary ( postscript ) of my research and teaching experience. Cecil is a new pure object-oriented langauge that we are using as a vehicle for integrated research in the areas of language design, programming environments, and optimizing compiler techniques. We intend for our techniques to scale to large, real-world programs, and to keep ourselves true to this goal, we're implementing the Vortex compiler in Cecil. We currently have about 70,000 lines of Cecil code in the compiler. SPIN is an extensible operating system microkernel which supports the dynamic adaptation of system interfaces and implementations through direct application control, while still maintaining system integrity and inter-application isolation. To validate my research, I have been one of the three principal designers and developers of Vortex, an optimizing compiler for object-oriented languages. For example, the compiler applies intraprocedural class analysis, profile-guided receiver class prediction, inlining, alias analysis, splitting, and CSE all at once, in a single combined pass. Part of the work on Vortex has been to develop ways of structuring optimization passes to permit this kind of composition while still allowing the passes to be developed largely independently of each other. Publications Some recent papers I've authored or co-authored. Personal I love very spicy food (as they say, \"mild is a four letter word\") and Coke . I should probably kick my caffeine habit. Most of my enjoyable moments are spent with my wife Heidi and my daughter Victoria . My wife and I spent our honeymoon on Kauai during Hurricane Iniki . I recently won a biplane ride from Galvin Flying here in Seattle (I guess I can't say \"I never win anything!\" anymore). It would have been fantastic even if we'd had to pay for it.",
