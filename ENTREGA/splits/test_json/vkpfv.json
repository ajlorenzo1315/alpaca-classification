We are at McGill University in Montreal. Other Information A small amount of additional information, some papers and some demo software from the mobile robotics group is available for FTP access . A brief abstract of some of our work on position estimation in different contexts is also available for download as a Newton book . This project deals with the exploration of an unknown environment using two or more robots working together. A short paper describing a trial experiment in this context is available in postscript form. One aspect of this work is the analysis of how uncertainty either in the map or in sensing devices relates to the reliability and cost of navigation and and path planning. Probabilistic sonar understanding Simon Lacroix, Grogory Dudek Pose Estimation From Image Data Without Explicit Object Models G. Dudek, Chi Zhang We consider the problem of locating a robot in an initially-unfamiliar environment from visual input. The robot is not given a map of the environment, but it does have access to a limited set of training examples each of which specifies the video image observed when the robot is at a particular location and orientation. We avoid this by using an approach in which the robot learns to convert a set of image measurements into a representation of its pose (position and orientation). A large-scale map might then be constructed from a collection of such local maps. Spatial abstraction and mapping P. Mackenzie, G. Dudek This project involves the development of a formalism and methodology for making the transition from raw noisy sensor data collected by a roving robot to a map composed of object models and finally to a simple abstract map described in terms of discrete places of interest. Multi-sensor fusion for mobile robotics MRL group members Click here for abstract (with picture) Spatial Mapping with Uncertain Data G. Dudek As a sensor-based mobile robot explores an unknown environment it collects percepts about the world it is in. In this project we are examining the relationship between the characteristics of object shape and the abilities of humans to recognize these shapes. Dynamic reasoning, navigation and sensing for mobile robots Martin D. Levine, Peter Caines, Renato DeMori, Gregory Dudek, Paul Freedman (CRIM), Geoffrey Hinton (University of Toronto) The goal of this project is to develop both the theoretical basis and practical instantiation of a mobile robotic system will be able to reason about tasks, recognize objects in its environment, map its environment, understand voice commands, and navigate through the environment and perform the specified search tasks. This will be achieved in a dynamic environment, in that knowledge of a (possibly changing) world may be updated, and the tasks themselves may be radically altered during the system's operation. The major aspects  of our proposed behavioral architecture are as follows: - A natural language lexicon is used to represent spatial information and for defining task commands.
