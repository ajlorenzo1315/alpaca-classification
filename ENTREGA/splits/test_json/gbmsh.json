    "Cuerpo": "My work and research at Stanford was about streaming live media, like audio and video, over the internet. As part of this I  modified IGMP one of the multicast protocols, developed protocols for multicasting /unicasting layered video, and  developed the Virtual Classroom system. The initial prototype  was deployed in the 1995 Spring and Fall quarters and used as an alternative to the Stanford Instructional Television Network SITN program which uses microwave links. We also stumbled upon the fact that other media, like text, slides, etc, linked with portions of video enhanced its usefulness  greatly. This lead to the formation of a company Vxtreme Inc. , Palo Alto, CA. Asilomar 94 IGMP (Internet Group Membership protocol v2.0) designed by Rosen Sharma and Steve Deering release as part of IP multicast v 3.3. Internet draft written by Bill Fenner. Rosen Sharma. Internal Report. Cool Stuff Image and Video Manipulation Language This is a language with video and images as first class data types. It allows operators on images and sequences like blur, speckle, transforms like affine, dct, subband, motion estmation. It also makes manipulation of image and video data fast and efficient. The implementation is writen in tcl/tk and currently has been tested on SGI machines;it supports 24 bit and 8-bit display . To give you a flavour of what the language looks like... set image [image ${imageFrame}$if -width 80 -height 60] iframe $if -nodisplay -file $filename -image $image putImageInCanvas $imageFrame $image $if There is a predecessor to this implementation (if you hate tcl/tk) which uses motif and has a language interpreter written in yacc, with limited shell like scripting. It generates all the files given the name of the widget. The files compile and give you a dummy widget. X-event snooper, recorder and player I consider this one of the coolest things I ever did. It doesnt have a scripting language but just replays what is recorded with lots of kludges to fool the X-server. Here are some of them Some of my chinese friends (makes me wonder?) Some people claim that it is from one of the ealry Jewish leaders... What is in a name .......:-)",
