Our current research involves: Document Length Normalization in Information Retrieval To fairly retrieve texts of varying sizes, document length normalization is commonly used in term weighting. We also propose a new and effective normalization technique. Some papers ... Our TREC Participation Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) is a NIST and ARPA co-sponsored effort to objectively evaluate various information retrieval techniques on an independent testbed. We have developed techniques to analyze the structure of a text and provide tools for selective text traversal. Some papers ... Papers Normalization papers: Pivoted Document Length Normalization.
