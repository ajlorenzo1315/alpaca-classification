Valiant Leslie Valiant Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics THEORY OF COMPUTATION AND MACHINE LEARNING Complexity theory, the study of the fundamental laws and limitations that govern computations, is not only an inherently rich mathematical subject but one whose conclusions and methodology are increasingly relevant to practical computational problems. Professor Valiant's research is focused on two application areas, machine learning and parallel computation, as well as the core area. The goals of Professor Valiant's current research are to derive models that capture the phenomenon of learning, particularly the learning of concepts from examples, and to use these models to identify efficient learning algorithms, as well as the ultimate limits to computational learning. For example, in the area of parallel computation, how efficient and easy to program can general purpose machines be made? In this connection, Professor Valiant and his colleagues have obtained some encouraging results concerning the possibility of constructing general-purpose, multiprocessor computers capable of executing parallel algorithms in close to logically optimal time. In the core area of complexity theory, relationships of surprising generality can sometimes be obtained. A theory of the learnable, Commun. Assoc. Comp. Mach. M. R. Jerrum, L. G. Valiant, and V. V.
