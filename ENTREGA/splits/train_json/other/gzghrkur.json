    "Cuerpo": "In this lab you will investigate texture generation by Fourier methods, cellular automata (CA), and partial differential equations. Transform texture examples: Cellular Automaton Textures The program SurfaceTension.net is a CA which simulates the effect of surface tension. The rule for this CA is: Sum the 8 nearest neighbors of each cell and the cell itself (cells are binary valued). If the sum is less than 4 or equal to 5, set the cell to zero. Red diffusion constant: Dred=0.03 Blue diffusion constant: Dblue=0.1 Red initial concentration is random with maximum of 0.5. The automaton rule for each time step is: Sum the 8 nearest neighbors of each cell (cells are binary valued, 0/1). If the sum is greater than zero (at least one neighbor) and the random number exceeds a threshold value, and the cell has never been visited before, then set the cell to one. If the sum is greater than zero (at least one neighbor) and the random number does not exceed a threshold value, set the \"visited\" flag for the cell. (Correction 3/20/96) Below is an example of a percolation cluster using a stroke font as an initial condition. the 3D array may be rendered by connecting it to an isosurface module (with it's second input set to 0.5) then to an image module. This mpeg animation shows the CA array on the left (isosurface rendered) and the array used to control the color of a torus. This mpeg animation is based on the rule: If sum==0 newState=0 If sum==1 newState=1 If sum==2 newState=1 If sum==3 newState=0 Modify Reaction.net to include a CA component. The CA should take as initial conditions the thresholded \"blue\" concentration. Life is based on the rule (where sum is over the 8-membered neighborhood): If sum==3 newState=1 If sum==2 newState=oldstate If sum<2 newState=0 If sum>3 newState=0 The CA should be coupled back into the reaction/diffusion equations as a source term for blue or for red with an interactor to control the strength of each source. So for each cell, there needs to be a term in the NewRed and NewBlue equations of the form strength * CA Where CA is the value (1/0) of the automaton cell. Make an MPEG animation of your favorite reaction/CA texture resulting from this process. One example shows this process with a CA source strength of 0.05 for blue and 0.0 for red, and using text as an initial condition for the CA. Another example shows a process with a CA source strength of 0.1 for blue and 0.05 for red, and using two strips as an initial condition for the CA. For both of these examples, the reaction equations were the same as above, except that Red diffusion constant: Dred=0.05 Blue diffusion constant: Dblue=0.2 Be prepared to demo the modified programs to show: The percolation CA The 3D CA The 1D CA The reaction/diffusion program modified to include a CA. You should use transmitters/receivers, macros, and comments in the \"Notation\" field of each module so that you and the grader can understand the program.",
