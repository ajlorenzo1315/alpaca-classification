(You may also use the workstations in the 232 Pentium lab after the design tools are installed.) There are also a number of other PCs and Macs which we will not be using much, if at all. Multi-meters, oscilloscopes, and other tools and equipment are available. Please help us to keep the lab clean and neat with equipment, manuals, and tools in their proper place. CSE467 and CSE477 have priority at during the following times: CSE467 A: Tuesday 1:30-4:20 CSE467 B: Thursday 1:30-4:20 CSE477: Wednesday 2:30-5:20 and Friday 2:30-5:20 You will be asked to vacate a bench if no others are available for those students. All other times are available to all students with a simple limit of 2 hours per sitting. A student already at a bench for 2 hours will need to vacate and take a turn at the end of the line. XACT is installed on some subset of the lab PCs, so you will have to shift between machines to use it. Remember: do not leave any files on a lab machines - they may be gone when you return and/or someone else may put them to use. In the DesignKit will be a card for keeping track of extra items that you may need to check out during the quarter. We will need a $200 security deposit for the DesignKit. The lock will keep track of when you enter the lab. The lab will be available for your use 24 hours a day. Do not allow ANYONE into the lab and make sure the windows and doors are locked at all times. Do not remove any equipment, documentation, or tools from the room. One for $20 to defray the cost of the commercial software you will be using and a $200 security deposit for the DesignKits you will be issued and other materials, parts, tools, equipment, and documentation you may check out from the lab. Make checks out to the \"University of Washington\". These will be due by the end of the first week of class. The $200 checks will be returned at the end of the quarter when the DesignKits and any other parts, equipment, or documentation borrowed in the interim are returned in good shape.",
