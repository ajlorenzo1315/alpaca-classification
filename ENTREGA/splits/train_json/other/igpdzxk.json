The first part of this assignment has you follow a tutorial where you should work in groups of two. In the second part you are given a circuit that divides naturally into two parts, each of which can be solved individually by half the team and then linked together to form a complete solution. I. Tutorial: Topdown Design Using ABEL with Schematics This tutorial has you design a counter that counts 1,2,3,..,N where N is an input to the counter. Design Problem: Serial Communication You are to construct a sequential circuit that interfaces a simple keypad to an LCD screen. Characters to be printed on the LCD screen will be keyed in using two key presses: one for the first 4-bit nibble of the character's code and one for the second 4-bit nibble. For example, to print an \"A\" one would key in a \"4\" and a \"1\". You will start by designing and simulating your circuit in Synario. The figure below shows the components of your system: (Figure 1) The Keypad The first half of the circuit takes values entered on the keypad and sends them serially to the second half of the circuit. Four instructions are required to initialize the display for the configuration we require (a 1 line by 16 character display). After reset, all you need to do is write characters to the display (the fifth line in the table). Basically, the display samples the RS line on the rising edge of the enable signal (E) and DB lines on the falling edge of E.  To keep things simple, the set up and hold time for RS should be one cycle before and after the rising edge of E, respectively. For normal character write operations, the RS signal should be 1. The easiest way to perform a write is by asserting the enable signal (E) for one clock cycle during which RS and data are both stable. This shouldn't be a problem as a key press takes a lot longer than your circuit will need. Before you begin to design, ask yourself what is missing and write down as precise a specification as you can. You may save yourself a lot of work in the end. Include this documentation in your Synario project and hand it in with your schematics. You may want to do this for other standard chips although you can use PLDs for most everything. To simulate the complete design, you will need to provide the keypad stimulus, which is easy to do on eight inputs, and you will need to check that the commands to the LCD display are correct.",
