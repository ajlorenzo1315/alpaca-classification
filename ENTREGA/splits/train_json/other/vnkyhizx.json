In the early stages of the helminthiasis, the news media popularly cited the Internet worm to be a \"virus\", which was attributed to an early conclusion of some in the computer community before a specimen of the worm could be extracted and dissected. Two lines have been drawn in the computer community in the aftermath of the Internet worm of November 1988. Meanwhile, several in the news media stated that the author of the worm did the computer community a favor by exposing the security flaws, and that bugs and security flaws will not get fixed without such drastic measures as the Internet worm program. The IAB issued a statement of policy concerning the proper use of the resources of the Internet in January, 1989 [4] (and reprinted in the Communications of the ACM, June 1989). Access to and use of the Internet is a privilege and should be treated as such by all users of this system. The NSF issued an ethical network use statement on 30 November 1988, during the regular meeting of the Division Advisory Panel for Networking and Communications Research and Infrastructure (and reprinted in the Communications of the ACM (June of 1989) [5]), that stated, in part: The CPSR issued a statement on the Computer Virus in November 1988 (and reprinted in the Communications of the ACM (June 1989) [7]).

On the In this RFC, we have chosen four to review: The Cornell University Report on \"The Computer Worm\" [8], presented to the Provost of the University, Eichin and Rochlis' \"With Microscope and Tweezers: An Analysis of the Internet Virus of November 1988\" [9], Donn Seeley's \"A Tour of the Worm\" [10], and Gene Spafford's, \"The Internet Worm Program: An Analysis\" [11]. In Section 2, the target of the attacks by the virus were discussed. and Gene Spafford's \"The Internet Worm Program: An Analysis\", described the infection of the Internet as a worm program that exploited flaws in utility programs in UNIX based systems.
