    "Cuerpo": "At the time, my father was a 30 year old Lieutenant in the Indian Navy, and my elder brother, Puruvir, a 20 month old devil. I always introduce myself to people by claiming that my name is as blatant a misnomer as you will find. Naturally, my full name then suggests that I am as brave in my convictions as the great Manu. My family name, Das, means servant. Oops! My Dad decided that my brother and I needn't keep the God part of the name. I met many people, but quickly forgot almost all of them as well. No scientists, engineers etc. I must have got it from my mother's family then. You might have guessed that I didn't get in. Madison is an amazing place, but after two years here I found that the urge to get to MIT hadn't gone away just yet. So, after getting my Master's degree in 1993, I decided that I had improved my credentials enough to finally make it to MIT. It wasn't the Ivy, I can tell you that. I've never understood why that plant means so much to some people. Anyway, I won't tell you her name, but I was young and optimistic and I thought it would be nice to cut the phone bills and hang out in the same place for a change. So I spent a year at Brown, and then we lived happily ever after.... Not so fast! She got admission to MIT! It soon became clear that whatever they smoke at MIT is enough to forget all else, and I was a single man again. The story of my life! The thing about Golf is, you play as badly as you can all day, but if you hit one great shot, that's all you remember.",
