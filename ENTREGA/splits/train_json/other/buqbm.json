You know what would make a Busy Executive really happy? Busy Executives could just come in and get right down to business. Just Plain Folks are very busy too, but the WWW for them is a just diversion and occasionally a useful information source. Just Plain Folks read rec.music.makers.guitar.acoustic and talk.politics.theory and sci.philosophy.meta. And they don't read them because they are are political theorists or guitar crafters or philosophers of science. Just Plain Folks don't want or need to optimize their quality time with the WWW not because they managed somehow to be more efficient that the Busy Executives , but because it just doesn't matter. Just Plain Folks don't always want messages that statistically correlate with the messages they liked in the past. I don't know what to make of these observations. The point of telling this story here, of course, is that I think we're at a significant juncture: The current proposal is aimed towards Busy Executives ; no solid proposals have been set forth aimed at Just Plain Folks . If this distinction matters, now is the time to find out. One more thing: I've heard estimates that the amount of information published every year is growing exponentially. Now suppose we get devise a scheme for filtering all that information that runs in time that is, say, linear in amount of information in the world. The counterargument, of course, is that humans make the information, and they have a limited capacity to make new stuff up, so the rate of growth of information can't exceed the rate of growth of people forever. The reason the growth rates are out of synch now is simply that the percentage of people on-line is growing (probably exponetially as well). Are we just about to hit the point when information stops growing so rapidly? It may well be the case that within 5 years half the US will be on the net, and we'll be able to handle it just fine. My prediction: current fantasies about the growth of the WWW are simply unsustainable. This just in. Fair enough.",
