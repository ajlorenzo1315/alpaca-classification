Required Text: James Foley, Anries Van Dam, Steven Feiner, and John Hugues, Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice , Addison-Wesley, 1990. Jackie Neider, Tom Davis, and Mason Woo. OpenGL Programming Guide . Josie Wernecke, The Inventor Mentor . Academic Press, Cambridge, MA, 1993. Gerald Farin. Academic Press, San Diego, 1988. See me (DeRose) if you'd like to borrow these one or more of these texts for a short time. The lab is located in Sieg 228. There will be three projects, one per topic area, plus a short exercise to get you up to speed on using the Indys. You'll work on each project in a team with one or two other students in the class. The last project will require you to create a short animation (30-60 seconds long). The projects we have in mind are: Project 0: Sierpinski (not due) : A simple program to create a fractal called the Sierpinski Triangle. Project 1: Trace (due 11/3) : A program to create relatively realistic images, complete with shadows, reflections, and transparent effects. Project 2: Sweeper (due around 11/20) : A program to create complex surfaces by extruding (sweeping) a curve along a path in three dimensions. Projects will be graded during in-person sessions with either me or Jim. During the grading session, we will run the project to make sure that it meets or exceeds the goals of the project. One grade will be assigned for all members of the team for the project's implementation. Late assignments are marked down at a rate of 33% per day (not per lecture), meaning that if you fail to turn in an assignment on time it is worth 66% for the first 24 hours after the deadline, 33% for the next 24 hours, and it is worth nothing after that.",
