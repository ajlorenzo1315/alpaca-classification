How do I get a .ps file? What's a good LaTeX2e book? I've made my own .fmt file, how do I get TeX to use it? How do I get TeX to use the macros in /p/lib/tex/macros? How do I get TeX and dvips to use my fonts? How do I print a .dvi file? How do I get a .ps file? What's a good LaTeX2e book? If you know a better one, let me know. I've made my own .fmt file, how do I get TeX to use it? Let's say I keep my .fmt files in /u/pkn/tex/lib/formats, then I would set TEXFORMATS to: setenv TEXFORMATS /u/pkn/tex/lib/formats: That would search my directory first and the the default directory (/lusr/tex/lib/tex/formats) 4. How do I get TeX to use the macros in /p/lib/tex/macros? You need to set the TEXINPUTS enviroment variable to setenv TEXINPUTS /p/lib/tex/macros: That will cause TeX to look in /p first, then the current directory, and finally in the default directory (/lusr/tex/lib/tex/macros). How do I get TeX and dvips to use my fonts? You need to set TEXFONTS to the directory with the .tfm files in it. dvips need TEXPKS set to the directory with the .pk files in it. How do I print a .dvi file? If you have the PRINTER enviroment variable set you can just type: dvips filename Where filename is the name of the .dvi file. If you don't have PRINTER set, use the -P printername flag dvips -P printername filename",
