Help us make things better for the next five weeks, as well as for next year. Please fill out this questionnaire and bring it to class on Wednesday. We don't know what your handwriting looks like. :-) Workload : How many hours a week are you spending on class? Are you happy spending this much time, or is it too much? Is there anything we could do to reduce the amount of non-productive time you spend? Lab : How is the lab working out? Has contention for machines been a problem? Lab/office hours : Are they useful? Are they at good times? Assignments : Are they interesting? Help sessions : Are they useful? Critiques :  Are they useful? How could they be more so? Lectures : Are they useful? What would you change? Team structure : How did teams work out? Was changing teams each week too awkward? General : Do you like the class?",
