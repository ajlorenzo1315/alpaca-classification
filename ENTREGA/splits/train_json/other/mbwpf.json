    "Cuerpo": "This paper reviews our recent work on applying inductive logic programming to the construction of natural language processing systems. We have developed a system, CHILL, that learns a parser from a training corpus of parsed sentences by inducing heuristics that control an initial overly-general shift-reduce parser. English queries to a small database on U.S. geography were used to test the acquisition of a complete natural language interface, and the parser that CHILL acquired was more accurate than an existing hand-coded system. Comparative Experiments on Disambiguating Word Senses: An Illustration of the Role of Bias in Machine Learning Raymond J. Mooney Proceedings of the 1996 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing , pp. (AAAI-96) This paper presents recent work using the CHILL parser acquisition system to automate the construction of a natural-language interface for database queries. CHILL treats parser acquisition as the learning of search-control rules within a logic program representing a shift-reduce parser and uses techniques from Inductive Logic Programming to learn relational control knowledge. One approach to solve the lexical acquisition problem is presented, along with preliminary experimental results on an artificial corpus. This paper presents results from recent experimenets with CHILL, a corpus-based parser acquisition system. This paper presents results on using a new inductive logic programming method called FOIDL to learn the past tense of English verbs. Using Inductive Logic Programming to Automate the Construction of Natural Language Parsers John M. Zelle Ph.D. Thesis, Deparment of Computer Sciences, University of Texas at Austin, August, 1995. This dissertation presents an alternative approach based on techniques from a subfield of machine learning known as inductive logic programming (ILP). CHILL treats language acquisition as the learning of search-control rules within a logic program that implements a shift-reduce parser. An Inductive Logic Programming Method for Corpus-based Parser Construction John M. Zelle and Raymond J. Mooney Submitted to Computational Lingusitics In recent years there has been considerable research into corpus-based methods for parser construction. This paper presents an alternative approach based on techniques from a subfield of machine learning known as inductive logic programming (ILP).

Mooney Working Notes of the IJCAI-95 Workshop on New Approaches to Learning for Natural Language Processing , pp.79-86, Montreal, Quebec, August, 1995. This paper presents results from recent experiments with CHILL, a corpus-based parser acquisition system. Inducing Logic Programs without Explicit Negative Examples John M. Zelle, Cynthia A. Thompson, Mary Elaine Califf, and Raymond J. Mooney Proceedings of the Fifth International Workshop on Inductive Logic Programming , Leuven, Belguim, Sepetember 1995. Our approach uses recent machine learning methods for inducing Prolog rules from examples (inductive logic programming). This paper presents a general framework, learning search-control heuristics for logic programs, which can be used to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of knowledge-based systems expressed as definite-clause logic programs. Initial experiments show that this approach is able to construct accurate parsers which generalize well to novel sentences and significantly outperform previous approaches to learning case-role mapping based on connectionist techniques.",
