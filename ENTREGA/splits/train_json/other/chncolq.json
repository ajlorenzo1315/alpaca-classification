At the Child's Play '95 workshop system designers analyzed and compared the computational characteristics of systems including AgentBuilder, Agentsheets, Cartoonist, Chart 'n Art, ChemTrains, KidSim, and ToonTalk . Theme: \".. but programming is not on the test\" This year's theme will be the impact of end-user programmable systems on education . How effective are end-user programming approaches as vehicles  for learning? Has programming generally failed as vehicle of creativity or could new programming and teaching approaches avoid this bleak scenario? What is the motivation to use it? What kind of skills are learned by using it? To make this work best we require you to contribute in two ways: Submit a position statement (not to exceed 2 pages) in HTML or ASCII assessing your work with respect to its impact on education. If your are not a system author, e.g., an educator, think about what kind of system you could use in your teaching activity. Your document will be put on the World Wide Web under the Child's Play heading. If your document is an HTML file feel free to refer to any page on the web, for instance, you can use this to point to your home page or pages describing your, or related systems. We have started to create a World Wide Web repository of generic end-user programming problem benchmarks and system specific solutions . We believe that it is crucial for the end-user programming and visual programming community to have such a repository as instrument to assess the applicability of systems to problems. Participation and Deadlines There is a minimal $50 workshop participation fee to cover hand outs and food. Send your position statement to Alexander Repenning (ralex@cs.colorado.edu). The position statements will be available on the web. Deadline is Feb. 5. but it will help other participants to send it as soon as possible. you get to demo your system (if you have one) to Child's Play and VL'96 participants Wednesday September 4. you are encouraged to also attend the VL '96 conference and to submit a paper.
