Lazowska Chair, Department of Computer Science & Engineering University of Washington and Chair, Government Affairs Committee Computing Research Association U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science Subcommittee on Basic Research Hearing on the High Performance Computing and Communications Program October 31, 1995 Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on the subject of the High Performance Computing and Communications program. I was a member of the recent National Research Council committee to examine the status of the HPCC Initiative, about which Ivan Sutherland has testified. I also serve on the Board of Directors of the Computing Research Association. Today I'm here to represent the members of the Computing Research Association:  nearly 200 industrial research laboratories and academic programs in computer science and computer engineering, where the nation's cutting-edge research and graduate education in these fields takes place. The HPCC program is a major success: The emphasis on \"high performance\" is appropriate:  cutting-edge information technology is a window on the future -- a \"time machine.\" The emphasis on parallel computing is a success:  while there is much more to be done, its viability is clear, and many important problems in all areas of science and engineering have been tackled. The inter-agency coordination and cooperation is working extremely well. The HPCC program is the nation's research and education program in information technology HPCC is the coordinated multi-agency initiative that supports nearly all of our nation's fundamental research and graduate education in information technology. Information technology is our nation's future. The HPCC program is our nation's research and education program in information technology. These agencies can and should be coordinated. The name has stayed the same, but the program has evolved and adapted: the focus on software has increased dramatically the focus on communications has increased dramatically the entire Information Infrastructure Technology and Applications component was added to the program, with its increased emphasis on research issues related to \"horizontal scale\" (that is, ubiquity) in addition to \"vertical scale\" (performance) HPCC has proven its ability to adapt. A strategic plan for the future exists Though much is done, much remains to do. The Computing Research Association strongly endorses the CIC Strategic Planning effort and the directions that it has identified. The role of universities and the federal government is critical The historical track record is clear:  over the course of many decades, federally-supported university research has played a critical role in essentially every aspect of information technology: timesharing, computer networking, workstations, computer graphics, database technology, Very Large Scale Integrated circuit design, Reduced Instruction Set Computer architectures, I/O subsystems based upon Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks, parallel computing, and others. Over the past five years, Microsoft discovered that in order to create new markets it needed new technologies in areas such as data compression, encryption, networking, 3D computer graphics, operating systems, statistical decision theory, and so forth. Universities look to the future. The HPCC program has been a huge success in allowing them to see the future through the \"time machine\" phenomenon. We believe that the authorization should be flexible in its approach, focused on fundamental research in a broad range of strategic areas and allowing adaptation as new research targets of opportunity appear. And we need to keep in mind that applications are important research drivers and paradigm shifters -- applications such as those covered by the Information Infrastructure Technology and Applications component of the HPCC program and the User-Centered Interfaces and Tools component of the CIC Strategic Plan.",
