Abstractions for propositions-as-types correspondence. Parenthesization control. well_fnd (1, 6, 129) Well-founded predicate. Rank induction lemmas and tactics. int_1 (9, 33, 169) Integer inequalities, subtypes, and induction lemmas for subtypes. bool_1 (17, 67, 239) Definitions, theorems and tactics for the boolean type and boolean-related expressions. fun_1 (9, 21, 106) Polymorphic identity and composition functions. Lemmas concern basic properties of arithmetic functions over integers, and induction principles. sets_1 (18, 52, 133) Family of classes for types with computable equality and inequality relations. groups_1 (50, 199, 752) Family of classes for monoids and groups. Exponential functions. perms_1 (21, 80, 623) perms_2 (5, 34, 422) Introduces the binary relations on lists `is a permutation of', `is a permutation of up to', and `is equivalent up to'. rings_1 (44, 126, 376) Family of classes for rings, integral domains and fields. Sums and products. Summation with indices drawn from multisets. factor_1 (16, 61, 386) Divisibility theory for monoids with cancellation. Develops theorems characterizing when factorizations are unique and derives from these the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Last modified February 24th, 1995 Paul Jackson / jackson@cs.cornell.edu",
