    "Cuerpo": "When a question asks you to describe a situation, describe in sequence the actions that one or more threads might perform. For example: \"There are two threads. Then thread 1 does this other thing.\" What can go wrong if the code while ( condition ) wait(); is replaced by if ( condition ) wait(); Describe a situation in which this problem occurs. (2 points). Describe a situation in which the following code returns the element in position 5: ... static void m(Vector v) { i = 3; return v.elementAt(i); } Can the same problem happen with this code? Why or why not? static synchronized void m(Vector v) { i = 3; return v.elementAt(i); } Can the same problem happen with this code? Why or why not? static void m(Vector v) { int i = 3; return v.elementAt(i); } Can the same problem happen with this code? Why or why not? static void m(Vector v) { synchronized (v) { i = 3; return v.elementAt(i); } } (1 point). The size() method of Vector is not synchronized. If you think there is a bug, describe a situation that exhibits the bug. In the lecture, I mentioned that threads could be used to improve the latency for balanced binary tree operations by doing rebalancing in the background. You don't have to understand balanced binary trees to do this problem; all you have to know is the following: A balanced binary tree is a data structure with three operations: insert, delete and lookup. Here are the signatures of these methods: public class BalancedBinaryTree { public synchronized void insert(String key, Object value); public synchronized void delete(String key); public synchronized Object lookup(String key); } In your design, insert and delete should return immediately after performing their respective operations; they should not wait around for the rebalancing to happen. You should submit an English-language description of your design. For each thread in your design, give an approximate priority for the thread, and say whether or not it is a daemon thread. You may supply code snippets if you wish, but you must describe everything in English -- a completely correct but uncommented implementation is worth zero.",
