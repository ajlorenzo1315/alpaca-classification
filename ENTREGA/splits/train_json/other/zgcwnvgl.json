Mooney Proceedings of the Thirteenth National Conference on Aritificial Intelligence , pp. However, sophisticated systems such as QSIM and QPE have been developed for qualitative modeling and simulation of continuous dynamic systems. We present an integration of these two lines of research as implemented in a system called QDOCS for multiple-fault diagnosis of continuous dynamic systems using QSIM models. The main contributions of the algorithm include a method for propagating dependencies while solving a general constraint satisfaction problem and a method for verifying the consistency of a behavior with a model across time. Qualitative Multiple-Fault Diagnosis of Continuous Dynamic Systems Using Behavioral Modes Siddarth Subramanian Ph.D. Thesis, Department of Computer Sciences, University of Texas at Austin, August, 1995. As systems like chemical plants, power plants, and automobiles get more complex, online diagnostic systems are becomingly increasingly important. We motivate and describe out algorithm for diagnosing faults in a dynamic system given a qualitative model and a sequence of qualitative states. The main contributions in this algorithm include a method for propagating dependencies while solving a general constraint satisfaction problem, and a method for verfying the compatibility of a behavior with a model across time. The algorithm can diagnose multiple faults and uses models of faulty behavior, or behavioral modes. Through our experiments with a model of the reaction control system (RCS) of the space shuttle and with a level-controller for a reaction tank, we show that QDOCS demonstrates the best balance of generality, accuracy and efficiency among known systems. Multiple-Fault Diagnosis Using General Qualitative Models with Fault Modes Siddarth Subramanian and Raymond J. Mooney Working Notes of the IJCAI-95 Workshop on Engneering Problems for Qualitative Reasoning , Monreal, Quebec, August 1995. This paper describes an approach to diagnosis of systems described by qualitative differential equations represented as QSIM models. An implemented system QDOCS is described that performs multiple-fault, fault-model based diagnosis, using constraint satisfaction techniques, of qualitative behaviors of systems described by such models. 321-325, New Paltz, NY, 1994.

Learning Qualitative Models for Systems with Multiple Operating Regions Sowmya Ramachandran, Raymond J. Mooney and Benjamin J. Kuipers Proceedings of the Eight International Workshop of Qualitative Reasoning about Physical Systems , pp. In this paper, we present an approach to learning the models for such systems. The qualitative model for each segment can be generated using any of the existing techniques for learning a single model. We generate, from either quantitative or qualitative data, models in the form of qualitative differential equations suitable for use by QSIM.",
