Spatial Learning Mobile Robots with a Spatial Semantic Hierarchical Model Doctoral dissertation, Department of Computer Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin. Abstract The goal of this dissertation is to develop a spatial exploration and map-learning strategy for a mobile robot to use in unknown, large-scale environments. This paper presents a design for monitoring and diagnosis of deterministic continuous dynamic systems based on the paradigms of \"monitoring as model corroboration\" and \"diagnosis as model modification\" in which a semiquantitative model of aphysical system is simulated in synchrony with incoming sensor readings. The design holds several other advantages over existing methods: 1) semiquantitative models provide greater expressive power for states of incomplete knowledge than differential equations, thus eliminating certain modeling compromises; 2) semiquantitative simulation generates guaranteed bounds on variables, thus providing dynamic alarm thresholds and thus fewer fault detection errors than with fixed-threshold alarms; 3) the guaranteed prediction of all valid behaviors eliminates the \"missing prediction bug\" in diagnosis; 4) the branching-time descruption of behavior permits recognition of all valid manifestations of a fault (and of interacting faults); 5) hypotheses based on predictive semiquantitative models are more informative because they show the values of unseen variables and can predict future consequences; and 6) fault detection degrades gracefully as multiple faults are diagnosed over time. Abstract This dissertation presents an approach to automated reasoning about physical systems in the presence of {\\em incomplete knowledge} which supports formal analysis, proof of guarantees, has been fully implemented, and applied to substantial domain modeling problems. Predicting and reasoning about the behavior of physical systems is a difficult and important task that is essential to everyday commonsense reasoning and to complex engineering tasks such as design, monitoring, control, or diagnosis. In order to clarify the structure of the knowledge required for reasoning about the behavior of physical systems, we distinguish between the model building task which builds a model to describe the system, and the simulation task which uses the model to generate a description of the possible behaviors of the system. Abstract A representation language for teleological descriptions, or descriptions of purpose, is defined. Abstract A global map of a mobile robot's environment is essential for high-performance navigation in large-scale space. Automatic Control Understanding for Natural Programs John Hartman. Automatic Control Understanding for Natural Programs Doctoral dissertation, Department of Computer Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin. SQSim is a simulator that produces a guaranteed bound on the behavior of an imprecise ODE model. The extended theory is implemented on a physical robot to explore a previously unknown environment, and to create an SSH spatial description of the environment. This dissertation describes the improved SSH mapping theory, the details of its implementation on a physical robot, and a demonstration and evaluation of several features of the implemention. The result of the learning is a rich, hierarchical model of the robot's world (its sensorimotor apparatus and environment). At the lowest level of the hierarchy, the critter analyzes the effects of its actions in order to define control signals, one for each of the robot's degrees of freedom. Qualitative Reasoning about Dynamic Change in the Spatial Properties of a Physical System Raman Rajagopalan. Qualitative reasoning about dynamic change in the spatial properties of a physical system. We provide the first set of solutions, given only a qualitative description of a spatial scene, for reasoning about dynamic change in both the spatial and non-spatial properties of a physical system.",
