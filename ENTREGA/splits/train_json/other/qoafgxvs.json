Dave Kamins and Jeff Vroom of Stellar Computer, Inc. Simon Baas and Hans de Jong of the Netherlands for the HP/VOGL port Pratish Shah of Kubota Computer for the Kubota port Mike Stroyan of HP for the PEX support The development of Vis5D was supported by the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center System Requirements Vis5D 4.2, the most recent version, works with the following systems: Silicon Graphics workstations with IRIX 4.x or later. On systems without 3-D hardware rendering is done in software with the Mesa library. 3-D graphics hardware is highly recommended. You should have two bytes of memory for each point in your data set in order to have maximum interactivity. The distribution consists of two files: vis5d-4.2.tar.Z - source code and documenation (5.4MB) vis5d-data.tar.Z - sample data sets, map files, topography files (4.7MB) If you've used Vis5D in the past you do not need the vis5d-data.tar.Z file since you should already have the files it contains. Password: myname@address ftp> cd pub/vis5d ftp> asc ftp> get README ftp> bin ftp> get vis5d-4.2.tar.Z ftp> get vis5d-data.tar.Z ftp> bye Precompiled Vis5D executables (along with map and topography files) are available for the following systems: SGI / IRIX 5.x SGI / IRIX 4.x IBM R6000 / AIX HP / HP-UX HP / HP-UX (PEX) DEC Alpha / OSF1 SUN / SunOS 5.x Pentium / LINUX Your Web browser will ask where to put the file and what to name it. Put it in the directory where you want to install Vis5D, and name it vis5d.tar (your browser should automatically uncompress the file). You can get rid of the tar file by entering the command \"rm vis5d.tar\". Installing Linux on your PC You can run Vis5D on your PC if you install the Linux operating system. It is a freeware version of Unix and you can find everything you need to know about it at The Linux Documentation Project Home Page .

Serving and Viewing Vis5D Files Via the Web In order to make it easy for modelers to examine each other's data sets, we have defined Vis5D files as a medium for exchanging information on the World Wide Web. Click here to find out how to do it. Getting Help Vis5D is free software and as such we do not provide real support for it. Email can be sent to Bill Hibbard at whibbard@macc.wisc.edu . We also have a home page for VisAD .",
