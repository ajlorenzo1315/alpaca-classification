    "Cuerpo": "My goal in teaching this course is to help you understand: What is an operating system, what does it do, and why do we have it. The fundamental abstractions provided by operating systems. The operating system acts as a resource manager for the computer and if you want to know what kinds of decisions it makes and why, then this course is for you. Who are we and what do we bring to this course? (Check out my home page for more details about what I do when I'm not teaching.) My attitude about teaching and learning My job is to come prepared to lecture every day, present and clarify material that I feel is important, and guide you all through a series of \"stories\" that are intended to convey the basic points of the course. I use slides so that I can work out those details in advance. I'll correct them as quickly as I can. Your Job Teaching is my responsibility. I can pretty much guarantee that if you operate using a few simple guidelines you will get a high grade in this course: Come to lecture PREPARED. The lectures are the course. When I miss a lecture, it is my responsibility to make sure that things proceed as much as possible as if I were there. The same has to be true of you; if you miss a lecture, it is your responsibility to determine what happened and how it relates to the rest of the course. I'm like you. If I thought we could, I'd have no homeworks at all. But, they're like working out or running -- you do it, as painful as it is, and you improve. The homeworks also help me to understand what you are understanding, and more importantly, what you are not. We've created an anonymous feedback page that you can use to tell us what you like and what you don't like. That's about it. Let's try to make it as productive and effective as possible.",
