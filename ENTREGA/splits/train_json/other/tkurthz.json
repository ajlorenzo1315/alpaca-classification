Don't worry if you had some problems with this one; that'll be taken into account when the semester's over. Suppose that inside you computer, the variable FUBAR has the binary value 01100011. What is its decimal value if FUBAR is declared as a) INTEGER --------------------------------- | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1  |      = 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 99 --------------------------------- 2^7 2^6 2^5 2^4 2^3 2^2 2^1 2^0 b) REAL (4 digit mantissa, 4 digit exponent) 0110     0011 is 1.0110 x 2^0011       = [2^0 + 2^(-2) + 2^(-3)] x 2^3 = 11.0 Find one type of each error (syntax,semantic,run-time,logical) (assume no line-position problems) PROGRAM SPAM C\tNumber of Eggs, Sausage, Beans, Spam C\tVikings, Dead Frogs, And Health Code Violations PRINT *,'Edible Food per Viking', VIKING/EDIBLE PRINT *,'(crunchy) Dead Frogs per Viking',DDFROG/VIKING PRINT *,'Health violations per dead frog',HEALTH/DDFROG END a) Syntax Error: INTEFER instead of INTEGER on line 6 b) Semantic Error: EDIBLE undeclared c) Run-Time Error: HEALTH/DDFROG is dividing by 0 d) Logical Error: Edible food per dead vikingshould be EDIBLE/VIKING (not VIKING/EDIBLE) What would be the value of FUBAR after the following statements: a) CHARACTER*3 FUBAR Only the first three characters can be stored, so FUBAR = 'CON' b) INTEGER FUBAR Integers truncate, so FUBAR = 3 c) INTEGER FUBAR The remainder of 18 when divied by 5 is 3. d) (Hint: Remember the conversion rules) REAL FUBAR 5 and 3 are integers, so the expression 5/3 = 1 *Then* we convert to the type of FUBAR, so FUBAR = 1.0 (Note: to avoid this, you need something like REAL(5)/3, or 5.0/3 (one operand must be real).
