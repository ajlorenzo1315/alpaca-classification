In the past, interpreting FNA samples has been rather subjective, but with our program we have been able to develop an accurate and objective system of FNA interpretation. With this computer program, we are also able for the first time to calculate a mathematical probability that a sample is malignant, rather than having to use fuzzy terms such as atypical or suspicious. By sharing this probability data with patients, we involve them in the decision-making process to a greater degree than has previously been possible. However, finding a breast mass does not necessarily signal that cancer is present: indeed, most breast masses are benign, not malignant. Currently, the only definitive way to distinguish between benign and malignant breast masses is for a pathologist to examine a sample of breast tissue under a microscope. Although FNA has gained wide acceptance for the diagnosis of cancer in the thyroid and certain other organs, clinicians treating breast cancer have usually preferred to employ less subjective diagnostic procedures such as breast biopsy. When looking under a microscope at pieces of breast biopsy tissue, pathologists can examine the intact structure of breast tissue and look for certain signs that provide definitive signs of malignancy. However, since no single one of these features, by itself, is able to yield an unequivocal diagnosis of malignancy, pathologists have had to subjectively weigh these various features in order to arrive at a diagnosis. In instances when the various cell features point in the same direction, the diagnosis of malignant vs. benign is clear-cut. In essence, the method begins with us mathematically modelling the cytological features, such as size or shape, that we need to evaluate in order to determine whether or not an FNA sample is malignant. Next we \"train\" the computer with data from two sets of FNA samples for which we already know the diagnosis -- one set of benign samples, and a second set of malignant samples. IMAGE ANALYSIS Using digital image analysis techniques developed by Mr. Nick Street, a Computer Science graduate student, we have now largely automated our computerized system for interpreting FNA samples. The computer then digitizes the video pictures and stores the data in computer files. FINDINGS AND RESULTS Our first goal has been to make the diagnosis of breast cancer from FNA samples more objective and accurate than has previously been possible. We now have a training set of 569 FNA samples and calculate that the system will correctly diagnose breast FNA samples 97% of the time. Our second goal has been to develop an objective method of determining prognosis for those patients whom our diagnostic program identifies as having breast cancer, that is, to accurately predict the likelihood that their cancer will recur. One of the key findings from our studies has been the discovery that with our computer program, nuclear features (i.e. nuclear \"grade\") are more accurate in determining prognosis than are determinations of prognosis based on the traditional measures of tumor size and axillary node status. Presently, determination of whether breast cancer has spread into a patient's axillary lymph nodes is considered to be an important factor in establishing prognosis: patients with tumor spread in axillary lymph nodes (e.g. node positive) have a higher likelihood of tumor recurrence than those without tumor spread into axillary lymph nodes (e.g. node negative). That is, we have found that analysis of a patient's FNA sample alone provides all the information about prognosis that we need, and thus that performing an axillary lymph node dissection solely for prognostic purposes is unnecessary.",
