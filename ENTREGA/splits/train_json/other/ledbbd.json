    "Cuerpo": "Specifically, the goals of CSE 143 are to learn the concepts of modularity and encapsulation, focusing on abstract data types, and the basics of data structures. After completing the course, students should be able to design and write medium-sized programs, to design interfaces to modules and abstract data types and provide one or more implementations of those interfaces, and to read, write, use, and document software components. To make these concepts and abilities concrete, we will study and use the C++ programming language. But 143 is not a class on C++! Most concepts taught in 143 can be applied in many languages, and there are many C++ constructs and features that we will not be covering. Please use the following address for all email to the instructor: cse143-instructor@cs.washington.edu . Any material covered in the lectures, the sections, the homework assignments, and the assigned readings is a fair game in the exams. There will be 5 programming assignments . Extra credit is limited to a maximum of 5% of the total course grade. Policy on Collaboration vs. If caught cheating in this or any other way, full disciplinary measures may be invoked, including a failing grade in the class and initiation of a cheating case in the university system. You can post general questions about programming problems and even pseudo-code snippets, but no actual C++ code. I will allow people to look at others' code on screens to give them help in debugging (because in this case only one or two people are seeing the code, and they are not getting an electronic copy). If in doubt about collaboration vs. cheating, just don't. This lab will be staffed with consultants who will be able to provide you with reasonable levels of help. The Mac lab in Sieg 324 can also be used, but at low priority; only when it is not being used by higher-priority classes can you use it. This course offers two levels of computing support: \"full\" and \"partial.\" Additionally, full support means that we will build sample executables for that platform, as well as an easy-to-unpack distribution of the code necessary for getting started. Remember, if you choose to use a partially supported platform, it is your responsibility to configure your system and understand how to build projects there. Here is a summary of the platforms we support.",
