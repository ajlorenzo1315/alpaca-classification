Academic History 1996: Ph.D., Computer Science, University of Washington (expected August 1996) Dissertation: Optimizing Object-Oriented Languages via Whole Program Analysis Advisor: Craig Chambers. 1993: M.S., Computer Science, University of Washington 1990: B.S., Computer Science & Economics, University of Minnesota, summa cum laude Recent Professional Experience 9/92 to present:  Research assistant, Cecil language group, University of Washington. Developed and implemented new techniques for optimizing object-oriented languages, including static analysis of class hierarchies [ Dean et al. 95a ] , selective specialization of source routines [ Dean et al. 95b ] , incremental compilation in the face of whole-program analysis [ Chambers et al. 94 ] , profile-guided optimization for object-oriented languages [ Grove et al. 95 ] , and improved automatic inlining decisions [ Dean & Chambers 94 ] . 9/91 to 6/92: Teaching assistant, Dept.
