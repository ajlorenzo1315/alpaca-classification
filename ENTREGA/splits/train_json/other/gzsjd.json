IF/THEN/END IF Statement Use the IF/THEN/END IF statement to conditionally execute one or more statements (Note: END IF is two words). IF (condition) THEN conditional statements END IF When the condition is true the conditional statements are executed; when it is false they are skipped. IF/THEN/ELSE/END IF Statement Optional ELSE specifies another set of statements to be executed when the condition is false . IF (condition) THEN true conditional statements PRINT *, 'Negative' END IF Indent conditional statements three spaces (i.e. column 10). IF , ELSE and END IF are on separate lines. Logical IF Statement If only have one conditional statement and no ELSE part then can put everything on a single line. 1) PRINT *, 'Monday' Note: there is no THEN or END IF . Nested IF Statements Can nest IF statements within the conditional sections of other IF statements. END IF The second IF statement is itself conditionally executed depending on the condition of the first IF statement. PRINT *, 'Proceed' END IF Use the general IF statement instead of multiple nested IF statements. Logical Expressions The condition tested in IF statements is a logical expression surrounded by parentheses. IF (logical-expression-1) THEN ... LOGICAL RENEW To assign a LOGICAL value  to a LOGICAL variable use the assignment statement, just like any other variable. - greater than or equal to? PRINT *, 'Not a bicycle' END IF Operator Precedence VERY IMPORTANT - You must remember the precedence order of the logical and relational operators. Example: if x and y are both greater than min then ... 'Graduate') THEN If the strings are the same length then they are compared character by character. 'Yes') THEN Comparisons are case sensitive - upper and lowercase characters are very different!",
