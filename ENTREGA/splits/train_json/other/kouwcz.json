The problems associated with using these types of facilities were studied and it has been demonstrated that using such facilities is technically and economically feasible [Karshmer, Thomas and Phelan - 1991; Karshmer and Thomas - 1989]. In the current work, we present results from the analysis of a system that reduces message transmission time on a two-way CATV network while not decreasing network throughput. Distributed switching over a single-trunk CATV network Figure 1 shows a simplified view of our two-level, single-trunk CATV network with M switches installed on the trunk. Each switch is in turn connected to a branch cable that supports K branch nodes (network subscribers). Each branch node has one output for branch upstream and one input for branch downstreamSince all trunk nodes have a certain level of intelligence, the traffic flow on the trunk is totally controlled. If our system is able to redirect messages at the earliest possible time, we believe the system can reduce message travel time, reduce message delay and increase system throughput. Figure 2 shows the simulation results for the 512 ( M * K ) node case with different node distribution on the trunk and branch cables. The distributions are 1 trunk node and 512 branch nodes, 5 trunk nodes and103 nodes per branch, 10 trunk nodes and 51 nodes per branch, 20 trunk nodes and 25 nodes per branch and 40 trunk nodes and 13 nodes per branch. The following figure shows a packet length of 512 or 2048-bits and a baud rate of 1Mbps. Figure 2 shows that with a fixed baud rate, (1Mbps) and a fixed packet size (512 or 2048 bits), the throughput (total number of packets) on each branch cable is almost identical. As the value, Num_Packets_per_branch is almost identical to the same values for G and S on each branch cable, it seems clear that putting the control node(s) on the trunk cable will linearly increase the throughput for the entire network. Since Slotted Aloha can double the throughput on each branch, we can see that the total throughput is also doubled. Figure 3 shows that the DELAY time may be reduced even if the number of trunk control nodes increases. If there are too many messages at the trunk control nodes waiting to be transmitted, the DELAY will increase. Increasing the Baud rate, tends to reduce the Packet_time, and therefore has a positive effect in reducing the Waiting_queue_SIZE, which in turn reduces the DELAY (see Figure 5). Increasing the value of M will not cause the DELAY time to be increased because the throughput on each branch is effectively fixed and has a normal distribution probability. Therefore, the more nodes (users) on a branch, the less frequently each branch node can send a Packet onto branch cable as the throughput on each branch is fixed. As a result, to the extent that a trunk node can handle the traffic, the waiting queue size will not increase and the DELAY time will not increase. The model clearly demonstrates that our design is extendable: we can increase the number of users by simply adding trunk control nodes to increase the system throughput without increasing the average system DELAY.",
