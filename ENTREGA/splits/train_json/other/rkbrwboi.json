    "Cuerpo": "Lexical Acquisition: A Novel Machine Learning Problem Cynthia A. Thompson and Raymond J. Mooney Submitted to the Thirteenth International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML-96). The problem occurs in the domain of lexical acquisition. One approach to solve the lexical acquisition problem is presented, along with preliminary experimental results on an artificial corpus. Corpus-Based Lexical Acquisition For Semantic Parsing Cynthia A. Thompson Ph.D. proposal Building accurate and efficient natural language processing (NLP) systems is an important and difficult problem. The lexicon, or the mapping from words to meanings, is one component that is typically difficult to update and that changes from one domain to the next. This proposal describes a system, WOLFIE (WOrd Learning From Interpreted Examples), that learns a lexicon from input consisting of sentences paired with representations of their meanings. The correctness is evaluated by comparing a known lexicon to one learned from the training input. The usefulness is evaluated by examining the effect of using the lexicon learned by WOLFIE to assist a parser acquisition system, where previously this lexicon had to be hand-built. A system, WOLFIE, that acquires a mapping of words to their semantic representation is presented and a preliminary evaluation is performed. Inductive Learning For Abductive Diagnosis Cynthia A. Thompson and Raymond J. Mooney Proceedings of the Twelfth National Conference on AI , Seattle, WA, July 1994. (AAAI-94) A new inductive learning system, LAB (Learning for ABduction), is presented which acquires abductive rules from a set of training examples. This contrasts with past systems that inductively learn rules that are used deductively. LAB has been experimentally evaluated and compared to other learning systems and an expert knowledge base in the domain of diagnosing brain damage due to stroke. Inductive Learning For Abductive Diagnosis Cynthia A. Thompson M.A. A new system for learning by induction, called LAB, is presented. LAB (Learning for ABduction) learns abductive rules based on a set of training examples. This is in contrast to past systems, which inductively learn rules which are used deductively. Each training example is associated with potentially multiple categories, instead of one, which is the case with typical learning systems. It is compared to other learning systems and a knowledge base produced by an expert. The results are promising: the rule base learned is simpler than the expert knowledge base and rules learned by one of the other systems, and the accuracy of the learned rule base in predicting which areas are damaged is better than all the other systems as well as the expert knowledge base.",
