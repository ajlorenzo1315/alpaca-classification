    "Cuerpo": "We can consider a transformation, T view from a world coordinate system to a viewing coordinate system ( Xv, Yv, Zv ). A full viewing system will also determine a view volume (truncated view frustum), which is the subset of world coordinate space which is to be included in the transformation process. Since it was very hard to create the view frustum in the world coordinate system, I have created the view frustum in the viewing coordinate space and apply inverse T view matrix to the view frustum that has created in the viewing coordinate system. N vector is a viewing direction vector and is obtained by calculating camera to position subtract camera from position. This Tview can transform any points in world coordinate system into the viewing coordinate system. In the case of view frustum which was created in the viewing coordinate system, and needed to be transformed to world coordinate system. After we have create the object in the world coordinate system, and transform the points into the viewing coordinate system, we need to transform the points in viewing coordinate system into the screen coordinate system again. By doing this, we are finally be able to simulate the camera transformation from world coordinate system to screen coordinate system. Also, this class initialize all the necessary variables, and handle all the events that user entered such as mouse click or enter the value of camera location, camera to, V vector, and V, H, F values. Polygon3D This class is the base class of any other objects that would be displayed on the canvases such as view frustum and cube. This class contains all the vertices on all three coordinate systems, and the points that would be displayed on the canvases which is called view coordinates in this class. This class is extended class from the Polygon3D class. Tview This class contains all the necessary information about the T view . Also, this class creates the T view by doing the followings Find V, U, N vectors Create the T matrix Create the B matrix Create the T view matrix by calculating TB Create the T view inv matrix by calculating B trnaspose T (-x) Tpers This class contains all the necessary information about the T pers . Paints the objects in the viewing coordinate system, and handle the rotation of the objects by draging the mouse on the viewing coordinate system. Matrix4x4 This class contains the matrix calculation methods. The detailed code of this project can be obtained by clicking on this How this program works If you like to simulate the camera transformation to see how the viewing system works, you may press on the viewing system. Viewing System You will see four canvases in the viewing system which are the world coordinate canvas, viewing coordinate canvas, screen coordinate canvas and the projection coordinate canvas. Conclusion I was able to simulate the camera transformation for viewing system in this project. I would like to thank my mother, Yeon-Ja Shim, for helping me and praying for me to survive from the darkest period of my life.",
