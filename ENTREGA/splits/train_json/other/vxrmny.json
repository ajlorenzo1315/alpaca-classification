If one of the drives fails, there will be a total of 11 drives remaining. This is no longer a safe state, as process A needs 4 drives, and process B needs 5 drives. Formula: (h x 0.1 milliseconds) + ((1-h) x 5 milliseconds) = average time Direct access: 8x4K = 32K is the maximum size of a file. One level of indirection: 8 x 512 x 4K = 2^3 x 2^9 x 2^12 = 2^24 = 16M 1/2 of the first block is wasted, 1/4 of the next 2 blocks are wasted, 1/6 of the next 3 blocks are wasted, and an 1/8 of the next 4 blocks are wasted. To exhaustively generate the encrypted version of all possible 5-character passwords, it would take 96^5 milliseconds.",
