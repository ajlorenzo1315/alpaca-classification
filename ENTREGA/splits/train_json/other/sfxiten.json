    "Cuerpo": "(You may use other similar books: see Notkin for details.) There's also a lot in this and other handouts; I expect you to read them carefully. The midterm examination will cover material up to and including design. The midterm will account for about 10% of your grade, and the final will account for another 15%. Your project grade will be based on the quality of your work, not just on your effort. Final evaluation of the group projects is done by (1) a demonstration of the project, (2) a group discussion of the project and the process of building it, and (3) separate discussions with each individual group member. Lectures Most of the lectures will cover topics such as the software lifecycle, characteristics of large systems, software specification, software design techniques, development tools, testing, verification, and validation, maintenance, etc. Because of this, the construction of these projects demands not only technical abilities but also skills in group dynamics. It is not necessary that every group member be involved in meeting each milestone. I will provide additional information, on a timely basis, about what I expect from each artifact; the document describing requirements specifications will be handed out on Wednesday. Sticking to the schedule for each artifact is essential, so that you can complete the entire project during the quarter. Don't plan on working on just one milestone at a time; you must always have (at least) part of your team looking ahead towards milestones that are coming up. The TA and I will try to answer these questions as if we were your customers (although with some special knowledge about the constraints of a one- quarter course). Every team must take and keep minutes at all of your meetings. The motivation for the minutes is that you may otherwise forget decisions that you made, which is costly in terms of time and energy. They are intended to help both you and us keep track of where your time is going. As with the minutes, don't format these. You may have categories later in the course for group meetings, planning, editing, debugging, etc. But in no case will I permit a group to use a language for which all group members who will be programming do not have expertise; there is too much to do this quarter to add on the burden of learning another programming language.
