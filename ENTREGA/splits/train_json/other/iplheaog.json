THE CORE REQUIREMENTS: The objective of the core requirements is to provide you with the skills that are considered to be fundamental to a sound background in computer science. In addition, a thorough background in mathematics and computer science theory provide a strong analytic component, as well as providing many useful concepts of interest to computer programmers. Computer Science Courses: CSCI 151 - Discrete Structures I 3 s.h. CSCI 370 - Computer Organization II 3 s.h. ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSE REQUIREMENTS: The student is required to select a total of 12 s.h. from the \"Systems and Theory\" group and 6 s.h. from the \"Applied Computer Science\" group. Systems and Theory: CSCI 331 - Structure of Programming Languages 3 s.h. Applied Computer Science: CSCI 343 - Systems Analysis 3 s.h. The following two courses may also be used in the \"Systems and Theory\" and \"Applied Computer Science\" groups above. CSCI 406 - Topics in Computer Science 3 s.h. PHIL312 or MATH 220 or MATH XXX 3-4 s.h. TOTAL 14-15 *Students usually begin with either MATH 161 or MATH 160 (Elementary Functions) based upon  the results of a Mathematics Placement Test administered to incoming students. ESCI 261 - Intro to Ocean 4 s.h. Students who intend to pursue graduate study in computer science MAY complete a total of 15 s.h. of additional Advanced CSCI Electives (\"Systems\" and \"Applied\" courses) and advanced MATH courses (200-400 level) approved by the academic advisor combined with a maximum of 6 s.h. degree in computer science. The second is an elective section, in which each major selects four courses, based on personal interest and career goals, from among advanced topics in computer science. Before being admitted to the next computer science or mathematics course in a sequence, a grade of \"C\" or better must be earned in every prerequisite course.",
