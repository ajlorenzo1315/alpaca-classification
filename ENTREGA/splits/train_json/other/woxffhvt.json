    "Cuerpo": "Skills Performance Tuning and Analysis Both hardware and software. Software OS: UNIX System V and BSD 4.3 kernel. September 1987 - January 1991: University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, M.Sc. I am still covered by the Intel NDA, and will work at Intel on breaks - I am now mainly a full time student pursuing my Ph.D. November 1995-August 1996: Computer Architect/Researcher , Microcomputer Research Labs; Leader, Intel Architecture CPU Research Group Manager : Richard Wirt (Intel Fellow). Defined global control register bus. Liaison between P6 Architecture and software groups: compilers , OSes (Intel and Microsoft), assembly language applications such as multimedia, video, 3D graphics, and games developers. Defined new memory types that increase memory to framebuffer performance by 4-7X. Acted as an x86 architecture expert, frequently representing P6 to Intel's Compatibility Architecture Review Team (CART). December 1985-November 1989: OS Developer From December 15 1985 to November 15 1989 I was a member of the technical staff at 1101 E. University, Urbana, IL 61801. October 1988-October 1989: Performance Evaluation Team Leader , Motorola Microcomputer Division, manufacturer of MC680[234]0 and MC88000 VME bus computer systems based on AT&T UNIX System V release 3. Wrote kernel tuning guide for SYSTEM V/68 systems. Budgetted for approximately 50,000$US of hardware and software resources and purchases. December 1985 - October 1988: Member of Technical Staff , Gould Computer Systems Division, Urbana, Illinois, manufacturer of Gould PN superminis and NP minisupers. OS group interface to hardware design. Development of tools for performance evaluation. UTX 2.1 (87-88) Performance : Member of the first Performance Team in Gould UNIX Development, responsible for tightly coupling performance issues with development. Investigated performance problems in system baselines: buffer cache problems (improved write throughput by >400%), memory layout. Class given by Prof. Roy Campbell of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, at Gould CSD Urbana. Andy Glew and Wen-Mei Hwu, \"Snoopy Cache Test-and-test-and-set Without Excessive Bus Contention\" , Computer Architecture News, Vol.18, No. Divisional Recognition Award, 1996 Intel Israel Design Center (IDC), for the creativity and driving of Intel Architecture Microprocessor Multimedia Extension (IA-MMX) Architecture definition; shared with many other members of the MMX team led by Alex Peleg and Uri Weiser.",
