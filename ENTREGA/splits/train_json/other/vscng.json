    "Cuerpo": "Having two disks will give you a backup and significantly reduces the chance of losing your work. Although you will work from your personal account, floppy disks are useful for backup and to allow you to work elsewhere on campus. Attendance : Attendance at labs is not mandatory, with the exception of quiz days (see below for more information on quizzes). Attendance is recommended, since lab is the best time to get answers to your questions about the assignments and students who go to lab tend to do better in the class as a whole. You are responsible for any announcements that are made even if you are not there. Assignments :The actual assignment sheets will be given out in lab. Homework assignments are due at the end of class on the day indicated on the assignment sheet. Most assignments involve turning in your work both in printed form and electronically. Late Policy : You can turn in assignments up to one lab period late (again, end of class); after that, they will not be accepted and you will be given a 0 for that assignment. The first two times you turn in an assignment late, there will be no penalty. Quizzes : Quizzes will be given during the first 15-20 minutes of class on the first lab day after each assignment is due. You are required to attend class on quiz days if you want to take the quiz (and get the points!). I will not give make-up quizzes . However, if you will be unable to attend class on a quiz day, notify me before the time of the quiz, and we can work out an alternate time when you can take the quiz. 3) The lab laser printers are to be used only for printing assignments for CS132. If you're unsure whether a specific action would be considered academic misconduct, ask Professor Peterson or myself. Pamphlets on Academic Misconduct are available in the front of the room. Problems : If you are having any problems with CS132, please talk to me or to Professor Peterson as soon as possible. Feel free to talk to me during or after lab, send me e-mail, leave a phone message, or drop by my office.
