Brief Overview Access-Limited Logic is a language for representing knowledge in the computer, and a method for drawing conclusions and answering questions from that knowledge. As for value (3), known as ``completeness'', for a language expressive enough for common-sense knowledge, it is impossible to draw all correct conclusions efficiently. In addition to our theoretical work on Access-Limited Logic, we have implemented a system named Algernon that embodies its principles. A more technical discussion of Algernon and ALL is also available.

Software The source codes for Algernon and QPC are available . R++ is available to university researchers. Algernon Users and History Ben Kuipers initially conceived of Algernon and Access-Limited Logic as a synthesis of frames and logic-based approaches to knowledge representation while teaching an undergraduate class on AI programming methods. James Crawford did all of the theory of Access-Limited Logic, including inventing the key concept of \"Socratic Completeness\", and did a near-complete reimplementation of Algernon. Crawford's PhD thesis is the definitive description of Access-Limited Logic. This was initially a collaboration between Adam Farquhar, James Crawford, and Ben Kuipers, and grew into Adam Farquhar's PhD thesis. Raman Rajagopalan and Jeff Rickel did their PhD research using QPC, and were thus regular Algernon users.",
