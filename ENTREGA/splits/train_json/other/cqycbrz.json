    "Cuerpo": "ACCCF, Austin Chinese Campus Christian Fellowship, is a group of Christians who get together in fellowship to encourage and support each other. The activities of the fellowship help Christians to grow in our spiritual life. What activities do you have? What Does It Mean to be a Christian? Christians are those who have given their life over to Jesus Christ. A Christian's basis of authority is God's word, the Bible. It is precious to us, and we try to understand, live, and obey it as Jesus and the Biblical writers meant. People are and will not be God, but all people are made in God's image. All the earth was good, but since the fall it is imperfect and now under Satan's control. There is no other way to go to heaven except through God's only begotten Son. We no longer live by ourselves, but the Holy Spirit dwells in all believers. We rely on God and not ourselves not only for His free gift of salvation, but also for preserving us and transforming us by His Holy Spirit. While we study, work, play, as help people as others do, we do this things to live lives pleasing to God, trusting in God rather than ourselves, and enjoying being in God's love. Our Basic Practice In all things, true Christians strive to please our Lord. We strive to obey the greatest commandment and love our Lord with all we are. We do not engage in the occult, superstition, idols, or give religious worship to any others. We must not worship through graven images. We strive to have integrity in our whole life, not to defraud or hurt others. We do not cheat. We strive to obey God's command to love others as ourselves.",
