I've just added a list of Things I Like . I like to read other people's similar lists. How? If someone has an interest in a little known, but amazingly good artist (like J. J. Cale or Taj Mahal), or movie (Delicatessen comes to mind), they might search for them with Alta Vista, and find a number of other like-minded people. Maybe even people they already knew, but didn't know they shared an interest. Here's a picture of us in Venice . My interests include electronics (mainly audio), unit origami, cycling, hacking at school, rock climbing, ultimate frisbee and cross-country skiing. I'm also a Dvorak keyboard advocate. These cookies have enough of it. I lost a bet involving a flow-bee. My officemates are Stefan Savage, Mike Feeley, prZemyslaw pardyAK, Ashutosh Tiwary, and famous post-docs Wilson Hsieh, and Herve Jamrozik. My wife, partner and best friend is Heidi , a really neat (non-CS) person. She enjoys gardening, reading and cycling, but doesn't have enough time to do these things since she works for Starbucks coffee. She is the ``coffee and beverage specialist'' for Starbucks' research and development department. mQCPAzHS4nUAAAEEAM1mWnAip2QfwZtq3rTyfg63hUg+wFD/W7CZUeCBQnNdW5jq Pz/e4fXGx29OmwJtJ0BOLm6BjP8i+4K5dk2l+C9iRjHPOK52236rP2KRup0KmFlm Dmu8UBRaR1c6aeP/IymHwkIQDjDHXe1Vu7G9FCOjJAeECcWt7VrtJqwu1BxBABEB AAG0IER5bGFuIEouIE1jTmFtZWUgPGR5bGFuQGVmbi5vcmc+ =aAr9 -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- A note about this page: I built this page on my Macintosh using Claris' neat tool called Home Page.
