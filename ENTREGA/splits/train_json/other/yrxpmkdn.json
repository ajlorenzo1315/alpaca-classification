The means of production should be distributed as widely as possible among the populace; they should neither be hoarded by a oligarchy, nor controlled by the government. Certainly the means of production should not be held by the government in the name of fictitious communal entities, but should be held by individuals in their own hands, or in the case of land, under their own feet. On distributivism: Third Way , a British political party advocating distributivism A history of distributivism from Third Way References on distributivism Related links: For a novel perspective on traditionalist politics in America see Peter Kreeft's article in the November issue of First Things The Traditionalist Conservatism Page Rerum Novarum :  An Encyclical Letter of Pope Leo XIII on the Condition of the Working Classes (1891) Quadragesimo Anno :  Encyclical of Pope Pius XI on Reconstruction of the Social Order (1931) Centesimus Annus :  Encyclical of Pope John Paul II on the Hundredth Anniversary of Rerum Novarum (1991) Recently published: a refutation of \" The American Distributivist \" (Daniel Krotz), both in Generally Speaking: The newsletter of The American Chesterton Society © 1996, The American Chesterton Society Against \"The American Distributist\" by Daniel Krotz M. De Marco Distributivism is and must be about redistribution. If we no longer believe that redistribution of the means of production is the road to the just society, then we are no longer Distributivists. If we are unwilling to say that the natural resources (especially the land) of a nation should be taken away from the Capitalists and distributed among the citizenry, then we lie when we call our political opinions Distributivism. Mr. Krotz alleges \"There is little room for relativism in a Distributist's belief system and such a system always concludes in belief in a soul and the idea that God will not abandon man after his death.\" I fail to see why the simple economic ideas of Distributivism lead so inevitably to an answer to the complex and vexed philosophical question of the soul. Also, as a potential possessor of a soul, I look for more in true religion than glib statements like \"God is the Head of the family.\" Mr. Krotz is not the first to link Distributivism and a thinly-disguised Christian faith or to posit Distributivism as the only political philosophy amenable to religious belief. Yet a multitude of Catholic Communists, Orthodox Socialists and Evangelical Capitalists vie to prove him wrong. Likewise, Distributivism, as a theory about the just society, can be detached from the spiritual as easily as any of its rivals. So on the issue of Distributivism and Religion, let us say instead that if religion is a good (and if any particular religion is the best) then it is bound to flourish in the just society. Distributivism is not weeding the garden or puttering in the garage. Distributivism is the farthest thing from paying off your mortgage, or, Heaven forbid, letting spare rooms to the dispossessed. Mr. Krotz implies that such actions are small steps on the road to Distributivism, but what they truly are is the pacing of a Distributivist soul back and forth in the narrow cell of Capitalism. How does one pay such a price? Normally, one pays for the land by selling one's labor elsewhere, and even after the mortgage is paid, one must go on selling oneself in order to retain the home, else the government come and sell it at auction to someone who will. Distributivism is not about owning the chain that binds you in wage-slavery, but about controlling the means of your own sustenance. A toolbox and a bench in the garage will not pay the mortgage or the taxes, but a genuine workshop might, in the unlikely event that the government would allow you to run a shop out of \"your\" home.",
