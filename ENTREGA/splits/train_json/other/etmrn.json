Using this outline code, and a list of guidelines required by your employers, you must now begin your plan of attack ... // function prototypes char   userInput(); char   userChoice(int& numChildren, int& numAdults); double bookTickets(int numChildren, int numAdults);    // returns ticket cost double bookRooms();                                    // returns room cost double reserveCars();                                  // returns car rental cost void printReceipt(double totalCost);                   // displays total cost void main()      // main should just call the auxiliary functions {                // and must be very short! double bookTickets(int numChildren, // returns plane tix cost int numAdults) { const int HAWAII      = 1;     // only three destinations const int GREECE = 2;     // are necessary for this program const int INDIA     = 3;     // -- do more if you want } Note : You have been supplied with a working function userInput() that accepts the answer to a Y/N question (and filters out invalid input). Hawaii Greece India If the user enters 'y' indicating YES, you will query for the number of children and adults in the family and return the user's response. (NOTE: the number of children and number of adults are returned by reference to the main program to be used at a later stage) If the user enters 'n', simply return this response The bookTickets Function The bookTickets function should do the following: Ask the user if s/he wants to buy airline tickets. If the answer is yes ('y'), then display the following menu and ask for a choice of destination: Destination  - PER ADULT 1.

The printReceipt Procedure The printReceipt procedure should display the total amount spent at the travel agency. It should work as follows: Call userChoice() function: If function returns 'n' your program must terminate with a thank you message. If function returns 'y' your program should call the other functions bookTickets(), bookRooms(), reserveTickets() and printReceipt() . If function returns anything other than a 'n' or a 'y' your program must terminate with an error message.
