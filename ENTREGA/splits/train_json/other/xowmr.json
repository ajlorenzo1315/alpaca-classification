Hill T.A. Jeff Shabel Due: Thurs, Oct. 10 Pertains to Chapter 5 of the text (Hennessy and Patterson, Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach, Second Edition, 1996). No late assignments will be accepted. Use dinero to examine a direct-mapped 16K-byte unified cache with 16-byte blocks (use the default for other cache options) using trace fragment SPEC92/085.gcc.din.Z . Do not believe these results too much, since you are using only one trace fragment. (a) What is the miss ratio of the direct-mapped 16K-byte unified cache with 16-byte blocks? What is the effective access time assuming 5.0 ns to access the cache and a 100.0 ns miss penalty? (b) Use the assumptions of part (a) except change the block size to 32 bytes. The larger block size could hurt the miss penalty. At what miss penalty will this new cache have the same effective access time as the cache in part (a)? Round your answer to the nearest 0.1ns. Ignore cycle-time boundaries. (c) Use the assumptions of part (a) except change the associativity to 2-way. At what cache access time will this 2-way cache have the same effective access time as the cache in part (a)? Round your answer to the nearest 0.1 ns. Ignore cycle-time boundaries. (d) When this trace fragment begins, the true contents of the cache in part (a) are unknown. Explain how you got your answer. For part (b), plot the miss ratios for both a direct-mapped and fully-associative instruction cache with block size of 32 bytes. Use SPEC92/085.gcc.din.Z as you did in problem #1.",
