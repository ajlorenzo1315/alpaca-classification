Technical Report AI96-247, Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, 78712, March 1996. Describes SQSim, an extended version of the QSIM simulator that computes numerical bounds on imprecisely-defined ODE models. Herbert Kay and Benjamin Kuipers. Numerical behavior envelopes for qualitative models. In Proceedings of the Eleventh National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-93), pages 606-613, 1993. MIT Press. Describes the dynamic envelope envelope method as implemented in NSIM, an extension to QSIM that generates predictions for semiquantitative models. Herbert Kay and Lyle H. Ungar. Describes the SQUID (SemiQUantitative IDentification) method for constructing bounds on a semiquantitative model of a continuous system by using measurements from the system. Herbert Kay. A qualitative model of the space shuttle reaction control system. Technical Report AI92-188, Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, 78712, September 1992. Describes a QSIM model of the space shuttle's reaction control system. Herbert Kay. Monitoring and diagnosis of multi-tank flows using qualitative reasoning. Master's thesis. May, 1991. Describes the NSIM algorithm and applies it to the problem of monitoring a high vacuum chamber during pumpdown. BKay",
