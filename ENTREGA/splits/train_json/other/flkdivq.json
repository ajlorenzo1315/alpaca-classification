    "Cuerpo": "The authors of the notes are identified by their initials: JH: Jonathan Herzog JM: Jeffrey Margileth CW: Charles Wurster RB: Everett Bull BCC88 Brassard, Chaum, and Crepeau. JH: One of the first papers on zero-knowledge proofs, it has a lot of the important definitions but it gets too technical. Mathematical Association of America, 1994. RB: Proceedings of a workshop in 1992. In Advances in Cryptology---Crypto '92 . JM: Has some good material, but not a lot and you have to dig for it. In Advances in Cryptology --- Crypto '92 . Oxford University Press, 1994. A Course in Number Theory and Cryptography , volume 14 of Graduate Texts in Mathematics . JH: A narrative artice on the DoD gag order on the FFS zero-knowledge proof system (with a quasi-technical explaination of zero-knowledge proofs and the FFS system). Linear cryptanalysis method for DES cipher. In Advances in Cryptology---Eurocrypt '93 . On the security of multiple encryption. RB: A self-contained description of the knapsack system and how to break it. National Technical Information Service, 1988. CW: Originally issued by National Bureau of Standards. Cryptology and Computational Number Theory , volume 42 of Proceedings of Symposia in Applied Mathematics . RB: The key result in the downfall of knapsack cryptosystems. The chapter on encryption was written by Rivest, and so is an excellent explaination of just about all important topics in the subject, along with a huge bibliography.
