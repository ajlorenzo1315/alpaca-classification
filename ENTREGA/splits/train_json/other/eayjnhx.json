    "Cuerpo": "I'm the TA for the class, and I also maintain the computers you'll be using for this course. My email address is jones@cs.byu.edu and I promise to answer email questions as rapidly as I can. Email is the best way to get ahold of me, but if you want to meet with me in person, I'm usually in TMCB 3325. Gofer background For this course we'll be using the lazy functional programming language Gofer. The rest of this page will cover running Gofer on the LAL machines; if you run Gofer elsewhere, check this out first. LAL Machine Background LAL Machines: If you're reading this email, you've probably already logged in to some machine in the LAL group. There are several LAL workstations, and you can log into any of them and all of your files will be there. There is also 'lal', but that's just a different name for leopard. Use whichever machine you want if all you'll be doing is email, gofer, and editing. If you forget to set the terminal type when you log in, you can do it later by isssuing the command: export TERM=xterm at the Unix prompt. Now that the terminal type is set, make sure you set your default editor. Starting and Interacting with Gofer Now you can start up Gofer reliably: type the word gofer and Gofer will start up, print out some information, and prompt you with a ? character. At this point, you can enter expressions for Gofer to evaulate. For a list of commands, enter :? Whenever you get tired of Gofer, you can leave it by issuing the command :quit at the ? The commands you'll probably use most often are :edit and :load Start up an editor from within Gofer by typing :edit <filename> where you can replace <filename> with the name of a text file (try foo.g). Load the file you just edited by issuing the command :load <filename> Hopefully there were no errors and Gofer will print out the results of evaluating the stuff in your file. Wrap Up That's all I have for now. Feel free to send me email, or you can ask questions to everyone in the class by using our class mailing list .",
