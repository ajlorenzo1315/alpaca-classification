    "Cuerpo": "Your class participation grade will be determined by your attendance in class and your active participation in class discussions. There will be two regular exams and a final exam. All three exams should be considered as cumulative, and will be administered in our regular classroom. Assignments will be made throughout the semester and may include readings, homeworks to be done on a word-processor, and programming assignments. Homework and programming assignments are considered separate. Homework assignments are strictly due on the date specified. Since we may go over the answer to homeworks in class, no late homework assignments will be accepted. Homeworks and programs are treated as separate assignments, and should be turned in separately. Assignments will be announced primarily in class and on the CS122 World-Wide-Web Home Page. Be sure to bring a copy of all assignments to class for review and clarification. These requirements will be discussed in detail in class and in additional files. I highly recommend your buying and using the text. The University policy on the grade of Incomplete (I) will be adhered to strictly. For this reason, if circumstances indicate that you may not be able to successfully complete the coursework, you should strongly consider withdrawing, auditing, or changing your grade option to pass/fail (if a grade is not needed). Cheating on tests, programs or homework will not be tolerated. University policy dictates that the minimum penalty for cheating is to receive a grade of \"E\" for the course. Person or persons using another's code, as well as the person whose code is being used, will all be considered guilty of cheating. Computer Accounts: Be sure to protect your account (via the \"chmod\" command in Unix) so that others cannot read your files. Your right to use the UK computer systems can be taken away if you abuse the privilege.",
