To do this, click on each of the filenames shown below. You should see a tetrahedron in the Image window. Use the control panel to choose a cube or octahedron shape. Note that the tetrahedron is defined interactively as a pair of \"Vectorlists\" interactors, but that the other two shapes are defined with list modules. Note also that any shape you make can be saved in a file to be used later in another program (which can Import the file). It it not necessary  to understand the program logic at this point (that is, you don't need to know what the Options, construct or replace module does) but you must be able to modify the defined shapes. The control panel has interactors to define the vertices and faces of a polyhedron. Edit the face list so that one of the faces in \"inside out\". Note that the \"outward\"  face of a polygon is defined as the side you see if you traverse the vertices in a counter-clockwise direction. Open the control panel and vary the color Open the sequencer and click on the arrow to make a simple animation. This net serves as a very brief introduction to animation. Assignment Modify the program MakePolyhedron to make a cube with one face that opens to show a propellor inside. Each different object you define will need to be connected to its own set of \"option, construct, replace\" modules. One of the inputs to the Color module is defined as \"front colors\" so that the back and front of objects will look different. Be ready to demo and explain your cube animation program in section. You should be ready to explain the function of every module in the program. Some attention will be paid to program layout. Back to Main Page Go to Lab 2 Last modified, 1/17/96 B.",
