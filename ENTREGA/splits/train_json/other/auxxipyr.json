All I can think of is the fact that X must be the same set on both sides of the equation, which means A must be the empty set, and B must be a subset of X. For example, an example of the equation is given as: X = {a, /lambda}X U {/lambda} > > All I can think of is the fact that X must be the same set on both sides > of the equation, which means A must be the empty set, and B must be a > subset of X. All I can think of is the fact that X must be the same set on both sides of the equation, which means A must be the empty set, and B must be a subset of X. For example, an example of the equation is given as: X = {a, /lambda}X U {/lambda} This is a subtle error and it is good to see a student find it. (i > 0) The question refers to a language that is the set of all strings with a positive, even number of a's over {a,b}, and describes it with the regular expression (b^*ab^*ab^*)^*. Since the empty string is in the language defined by the expression and not in the language generated by the grammar, then it is impossible to prove they are equivalent. was necessary and a more general B.L. bbabb is not necessarily an element of L since the number of a's and b's in it differs from the number of a's and b's in aab and bb combined. Sorry for missing these before, I'll correct them on the web, -j To: cse322@cs Subject: Homework 10, problem 1 Date: Thu, 07 Mar 1996 11:54:33 PST From: Richard Ladner <ladner@whalespout.cs.washington.edu> Instead of building a DPDA for the set of strings with an equal number of a's as b's do it for the following set.
