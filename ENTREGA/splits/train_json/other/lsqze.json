    "Cuerpo": "And Mr. Data, have you been able to access their command pathways? We will send this program, for some reason called Windows , through the Borg command pathways. Picard: But the Borg have the ability to adapt. Data: Captain, we have successfully installed the Windows in the Borg's command unit. As expected, it immediately consumed 85% of all available resources. Geordi: Our scanners have picked up an increase in Borg storage and CPU capacity, but we still have no indication of an upgrade to compensate for their increase. Data: Sir, I believe there is a reason for the failure in the upgrade. Appearently the Borg have circumvented that part of the plan by not sending in their registration cards. Riker: Captain, we have no choice. Geordi: [excited] Wait, Captain! Data: [studying displays] Appearently the Borg have found the internal Windows module named Solitaire , and it has used up all available CPU capacity. Riker: Geordi, what is the status of the Borg? Geordi: As expected, the Borg are attempting to re-engineer to compensate for increased CPU and storage demands, but each time they successfully increase resources I have setup our closest deep space monitor beacon to transmit more Windows modules from something called the Microsoft Fun-Pack. Data: Current Borg solution rates allow me to predict an interest time span of 6 more hours. Picard: Identify. If you will look closer I believe you will see that they are carrying something recognized by twenty-first century man as doeskin leather briefcases, and wearing Armani suits. Geordi: It can't be. Riker: They have surrounded the Borg ship and are covering it with all types of papers. Data: I believe that is known in ancient vernacular as red tape. Riker: They're tearing the Borg to pieces!",
