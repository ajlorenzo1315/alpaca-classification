    "Cuerpo": "Our work will be divided into three parts:  a survey of various techniques developed throughout the years, an implementation of one such technique, and the presentation of our results. The availability of suitable input devices or a pre-defined face mesh would limit the accuracy and aesthetic quality of the finished product. This layer enables the generation of expressions that are not necessarily humanly possible, such as asymmetric movement of two sides of the face. As the objective of many projects was to emulate the human face during speech, there usually exists another layer above expressions that include phonemes (speech primitives). A complete data set of phonemes allow the synthesized face to look like it is coordinated with speech which is played back separately. It is also difficult to generalize work on one face mesh to another. One such attempt utilizes B-spline patches that were defined manually on an actual digitized face mesh [ Nahas88 ]. The control points for the B-spline patches were moved to effect the distortion of the face. The human facial muscles are capable of a large amount of expressions, and realistic simulation of muscles requires the simulation of muscle action wrapping around the skull structure, jaw rotation, and folding and stretching properties of skin. Pseudo-muscles A hybrid approach would be to simulate muscles that are not necessarily anatomically-correct [ After the data set was complete, we decided that the available functions to deform the face mesh were overly complicated, and derived a simple one: 1 P' = P + ( -------------- ) ( Pd - P ) t | Po + P | + 1 where t is the time parameter running from 0 to 1, Po is the point where the force is applied, Pd is the point of attractive force, and P is every face vertex in the bounding box. An example of this muscle model is shown below: This formula had an unacceptable side effect of seemingly to \"pinch\" the points close to Po towards Pd . R defines the radius of influence, and while closely related to the size of the bounding box, is a separate parameter. Note that the Pd - Po term in this formula moves all the vertices in the bounding box and the radius of influence parallel to the vector between the point of force application towards the point of attraction. The direction of motion is now defined by P - Pd , which is in the direction of the point of attraction (similar to formula 1). The reason we inverted the sign of this formula was because we felt that a positive K should denote contraction and a negative K should denote expansion, in order to be consistent with formula 2. The example on the left below shows a contracting sphincter muscle and the one on the right shows an expanding sphincter muscle: Putting it all together Armed with the face mesh and the muscles, what remains is the definition of parameters, which is largely a tedious trial-and-error task.
