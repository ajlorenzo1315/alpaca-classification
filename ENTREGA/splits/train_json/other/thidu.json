    "Cuerpo": "All required readings will be made available in class. Required We will hand out course notes and copies of the relevant papers. Whenever possible, we will place these on-line, but many of the papers are not available on line and can only be copied. The slides used in lecture will be available electronically, as will any handouts that we write and several of the papers for the course. We expect to give out mostly A's, but this depends on your doing the assigned work. First, you will be graded on your answers to three homework assignments that will require programming and/or written responses. For each paper you read, you must post a critique of the paper on the Web (see below). You should work in groups of two or three on all assignments. We expect all students in a group to be equally able to answer questions about the program or project. The work you submit in CS 631 is expected to be the result of your individual effort. The Bottom Line: What You Must Do You must do three things to complete this course: assignments, critiques, and the project. Critiques For 75% of the papers you receive, you must publish a critique of the paper on the web. The critique should be available from your CS 631 web page (which you will create in homework assignment one). For each paper, your critique should answer the following questions in one to two paragraphs: What is the MAIN POINT of this paper? We will examine these critiques to determine if you have read and understood the paper.. Project Guidelines The final project is a small scale research project. It must have two qualities: it must attack a research problem, and it must pertain to multimedia. So how can you tell what is interesting. Remember: it is just as hard to do uninteresting research as it is to do interesting research. The first milestone ( Sept 23 rd ) will be a brief written presentation (one to two paragraphs) of your two proposed projects (a primary and a backup). The second milestone ( Sept 30 th ) will be a short (approximately 2 page) written project proposal.",
