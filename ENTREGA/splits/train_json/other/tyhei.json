You'll find more in-depth help on the Help menu of your browser . The CSE/457 home page uses tables, a feature that is best supported by Netscape. Mosaic tends to completely leave out any table entries containing links, and occasionally even seg-faults. If you are unable to use tables, there is a version of the home page done in traditional HTML style: http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/457/notables.html Mosaic, Netscape, Lynx -- what's the difference? Mosaic was the original graphical web browser, created by Marc Andreesen and others at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaigne. So what's the difference between the two? Universities tend to support Mosaic, because it is free, and the source is distributed, so it can compile on obscure and obsolete operating systems (eg Ultrix). Netscape is considered \"faster\" because it displays a page as it loads. With Mosaic, you have to wait until the entire page is loaded. It uses 24-bit color if available, whereas Mosaic is limited to 8-bit color. It isn't very exciting, but it can be useful if you can't support graphics -- like if you are dialing in from home and not using a SLIP/PPP connection. More information on all three can be found on these pages: Department info on Mosaic NCSA Mosaic Netscape Communications About Lynx Using Netscape on the Indys Though Netscape isn't officially supported in the IndyLab, we have a copy for you to use. This can be found at /cse/courses/cse457/bin/netscape . You'll need to set up one thing in Netscape so that you can use helper applications (eg sound-players, movie-players, installer-scripts, etc.). Change the options-menu to Helper Applications . Or, ask one of the TAs for help.",
