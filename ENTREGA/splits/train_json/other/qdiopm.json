Current Announcements Synopsis How to access What is in /usr/public What should not be in /usr/public Directory organization How to obtain further help Other pages available in /usr/public Current List of czars. It contains all software which is considered useful to the entire community and is not officially supported by adm. All software in /usr/public is provided without any guarantees by other users. Periodically this czar will walk through the directory looking for space, and if you have installed something, you may receive a message from the czar asking if the program is still useful. We are always short of space, so this may happen fairly often. The public-czar is also available to provide assistance if you need help finding or installing something, or if you feel something needs to be changed. Games are stored in a directory which may be accessed with \"/usr/local/public/games\". Sources for executables should be stored in /usr/public/src. Look in that directory for some examples. If you would like to add WWW info, contact the public-czar, who will add it to this file. All public games are stored in /usr/public/.../games. These are managed by the games czar who is ultimately responsible for what stays and what goes. Sources for most games are in /usr/public/src/games. If something seems strange, do not hesitate to bring it up. To make access somehat machine-independent, architecture-dependent executables are available in /usr/local/pub.bin, which will always be a link to the appropriate directory. Remember, solaris is on the way, like it or not. If it makes you feel more comfortable, add a link from executables you install in /usr/public/share/bin to corresponding directory entries in /usr/public/{sun4,solaris}/bin. If you install in the wrong place, the public-czar will always come around to correct you:-) Here is a summary: /usr/public/adm: for the public-czar, look here for stats if you want. /usr/public/include: Architecture-independent include files. This should be a link to /usr/public/share/include. Any program, whether it is one file or not, should be installed in a directory here.",
