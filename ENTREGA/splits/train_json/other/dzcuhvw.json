    "Cuerpo": "You can use the vt100 command to do this when you log in or you can use this command: setenv TERM 'vt100' Handin has severe problems otherwise. Your grader and you both have the password (the students don't). A program called handin is installed in the bin directory of that account. The student invokes the program like this: ~account/bin/handin class assign# file Example: ~cs742/bin/handin cs742 1 myprog.c Handin checks several things that you or your grader need to set up. In the home directory for the class account , there should be a file called students. This lists the student usernames for your class, one per line, no spaces, tabs, punctuation, etc...  You or your GTA must enter this data into the file. Assignment numbers must be integers 0 handin must be installed setuid to the grading account in the bin subdirectory (I do that). You may have an optional file called assignments.dat in the home directory of the class account. It has the following format: assignment#;due-date;comment The assignment# must be an integer (see above). Comment can be free-form (up to 60 columns or so (no special characters please)). handin looks in the subdirectory /usr/users/User3/classes/cs540 for the students file. If the student is not in that file, handin won't let the student hand in anything. handin looks for a subdirectory for the assignment number. handin looks for the source files (sees if they are ordinary files that suit the syntax (filenames must consist of dots, [a-z], [0-9]). It also checks to see if the student owns the file they are handing in (a very simple check for attempted cheating). If the file lists a due date of 15-FEB-1995, when the 16th comes around, students will not be able to hand in that particular assignment anymore. example: /usr/users/User3/classes/cs540  is the home directory for the grader account. The subdirectory and all the files in there are owned by the grader account (not jones (that is where the suid comes in)). jones cannot access this directory or the files (they are chmoded to 700). If a student hands in a file twice for the same assignment, the handin program will detect that the file has already been handed in and will ask the student if they want to overwrite it.",
