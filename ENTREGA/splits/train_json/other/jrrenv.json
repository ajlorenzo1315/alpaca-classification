In this exercise you will use all of the techniques you have learned this semester to produce an animated scene. Some of the objects should have a hierarchical structure and you should demonstrate use of polyhedra and parametric surfaces. Lighting should be appropriate to your scene. CA or reaction based texture maps may be appropriate for some objects. The animation must start with a title frame which includes title, author, and copyright notice. The following program is one example of a title page generator. To use them on the HP systems add the line below to your .cshrc file setenv DXFONTS /usr/lpp/dx/fonts:/fsys/grieg/a/cs418/Fonts Then source your .cshrc file. To use them on the IBM systems add the line below to your .cshrc file setenv DXFONTS /usr/lpp/dx/fonts:/u/tc/devine/public/fonts Then source your .cshrc file. The fonts which are available (once you modify the .cshrc file) in DX are named FutMath, DutBld, FutHvy, FutLED2d, FutLED3d, LatNov, SwiBld, and SwiBlk. A tree growing. A robot spacecraft battle. A city street. Be prepared to demo your animation in section. You must hand in a one page written description of your animation including both author's names, the title, and a brief summary of the plot and the techniques you used. This document must be printed from a Web page (with no links) that you design. To demonstrate your animation you must mpeg compress it. You may need to trade off frame size, animation length, and mpeg compression quality to achieve a maximum file size of 5Mbytes. You should be able to explain your program. Land.",
