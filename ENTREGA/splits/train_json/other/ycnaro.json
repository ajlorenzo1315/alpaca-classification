    "Cuerpo": "As for next week, Monday we'll do-least-squares, Wed is the quiz (it'll be shorter than last time), then the rest of Wed. and all of Fri. will be review, so bring questions. A circle is not a function in terms of x and y (x=0 gives two values of y, -1 and 1), but it is a function of t from 0 to 2pi  (each (x,y) pair of our circle corresponds to exactly one t on 0 to 2pi). For this reason you can't really work with xincr (you have no idea how many y values you'll need to test for), but you can work with tincr. Program 8 will be up today. Week 12-13 notes will be up today as well. [11/13/96]Quiz4 Solutions are available on the Web Page Also, I got my days mixed up in class. Program 6 is due a week from FRIDAY, not a week from Wed.

One question on 1-d arrays, one of multidim. If you wish to copy it to your working directory, get into your working directory and type COPY \\PUBLIC\\TICK\\PROG3.FOR filename where filename stands for whatever you want to rename prog3.for to (presumably, if you already have your own version of program 3 called prog3.for, you'll want to rename my version, because it's always good to keep your copy around, in case you decide later on that you don't want to use my version.
