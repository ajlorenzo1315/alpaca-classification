I have dual US and Canadian citizenship. Contact Information Department of Computer Science University of Washington Seattle, WA, 98195-2350 Voice: (206) 685-4087 (day) or (206) 322-2099 (evening) Fax:  (206) 543-2969 E-mail: brendan@cs.washington.edu WWW: http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/brendan/ Research My general interests run to applying theoretical techniques to solve problems which have practical motivation. Specifically, I have worked on the problem of comparing DNA clones based on their \"multiple complete digest\" fingerprint. Using this overlap test, I have implemented a clone ordering algorithm which is crucial to finishing the map. The problem is to discover the important features which determine the general type and lethality of a particular cell line. This is joint with work with Dick Karp and Leroy Hood's lab in the molecular biotechnology department at the University of Washington. I have also done some work in computational astrophysics; my contribution being a new parallel algorithm and implementation for detecting clusters in points sets. With Maria Klawe I developed new upper and lower bounds for computing the optimal alphabetic tree data structure. Education Ph.D. (expected fall 1996), Computer Science, University of Washington.
