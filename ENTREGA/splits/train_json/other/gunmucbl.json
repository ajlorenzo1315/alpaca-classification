As part of developing the Springbok system, we have examined several issues related to multi-FPGA systems. In \"Mesh Routing Topologies for Multi-FPGA Systems\" we have done a quantitative study of nearest-neighbor routing topologies, and developed structures that greatly improve inter-FPGA routing efficiency. In \"Pin Assignment for Multi-FPGA Systems\" we examined the problems of global routing in multi-FPGA systems, and proposed an algorithm for pin assignment for arbitrary FPGA topologies. The problem is that the global routing of FPGA systems will in general occur before the mappings in individual FPGAs have been placed. This means that the exact start and finish locations for inter-FPGA signals aren't fixed, and complete routing cannot be done by standard algorithms. This is handled by placing all FPGAs simultaneously via force-directed placement, though spring-simplification rules based on physical laws make the problem manageable. We have also considered the problem of partitioning for multi-FPGA systems. The results of this survey is in \"An Evaluation of Bipartitioning Techniques\" . We also considered the problem of how to apply bipartitioning iteratively to multi-FPGA systems. Specifically, it is important to figure out what order of cuts in the logic correspond to what locations in the multi-FPGA system, so we both know how many I/O resources are available, as well as picking the best order to optimize for locality, thus minimizing the length and amount of inter-FPGA routing.
