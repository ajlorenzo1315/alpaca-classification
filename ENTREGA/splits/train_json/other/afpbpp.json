    "Cuerpo": "1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7. Problem Description: For this program you will read in a list of 10 INTEGER values from the user, entered one per line. These values will be read into an array of integers . After reading in all the numbers your program will perform a series of operations on the array. The operations that you will implement are: Find the minimum and maximum value in the array. That is, check each adjacent pair of numbers in the array to see if they are in order. This assignment uses user-defined functions and user-defined subroutines (Chp 6) and one-dimensional arrays (Chp 7). Example: If the user enters the following 10 INTEGER values 14 9 5 21 35 10 16 11 66 65 then your program should display (hint: use this to check your results) The minimum value is   5 The maximum value is  66 There are  2 prime numbers The numbers are neither ascending nor descending Program Design: To find the minimum and maximum number in the array, assume the first number in the array is the current min/max and then go through the rest of the array and compare each number with the current min/max and re-assign these values accordingly (e.g. similar to finding the minimum time in Program #2). Note: the numbers can be both positive and negative INTEGER s. To count the number of primes go through the array and for each number check to see if it is a prime number or not; i.e. see if any value besides 1 and the number itself evenly divides into it. To determine if the list of numbers is in strictly ascending or descending order, go through each pair of numbers in the array. If the second number is greater than or equal to the first then the list must necessarily not be in descending order. If the second number is less than or equal to the first then the list must necessarily not be in ascending order. Not: it only takes one pair of numbers in the wrong order to make the whole list not ascending/descending. Program Structure: Your program must first read in the 10 numbers into a one-dimensional array using a DO loop. This subroutine is passed in the array of integers and passes out both the minimum and maximum value. This function is passed in the array of integers and returns the total number of primes. This function is passed in the array of integers and returns whether the numbers are ascending, descending or neither. You also have to hand in a printed copy of your FORTRAN source code file and the screen output when your program is run with the four sets of test data given in the gradesheet. Note that you will be graded on correct output for the input values given below, so before handing it in you must run your program with these values and manually check that your program gives the correct results in every case.
