    "Cuerpo": "Monte Carlo methods have been applied to this problem in order to reduce the amount of computation (1). In recent years numerous diffusion algorithms have been proposed to solve the problem of dynamic load balancing on parallel computers (3,4). In the current research we have investigated the utility of diffusion algorithms to the problems of dynamic load balancing and partitioning in Monte Carlo path tracing. We have implemented a Monte Carlo algorithm as a message driven concurrent pipeline, and have employed a diffusion algorithm to perform dynamic load balancing. We have designed a diffusion algorithm to partition complex geometric models among the processors of a parallel computer and have performed initial simulations to validate this approach. The implementation has been tested on up to 128 processors, and on platforms that include IBM SP1 and SP2 systems, networks of workstations, and uniprocessors. Future Plans. We plan to continue to develop this implementation as well as to explore complementary rendering techniques (e.g., radiosity, finite element methods) that are amenable to parallel implementation. Funding. This work has been funded by the Cornell Program of Computer Graphics, the Caltech Center for Advanced Computing Research, and the NSF Center for Research in Parallel Computation.
