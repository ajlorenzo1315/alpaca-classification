    "Cuerpo": "It will introduce various types of parametric surfaces. Procedure: First you will need to download two files. To do this, click on each of the filenames shown below. One of the Compute modules performs the main operation of mapping a 2D grid to 3D coordinates to make the parametric surface. Assignment: Quadric surfaces: Modify the Compute in Parametric.net to produce a unit sphere. Use another Compute module to convert the sphere to a \"superquadric\". That is, if the vector [x,y,z] is a quadric surface, then [x,y,z]^n is a superquadric surface, where the power of a vector just means the power of each term. You will need to handle negative values of x, y, and z in the compute. The two images below show a sphere modified by n=.3 and n=3 respectively. Figures of rotation: Modify the program to produce a figure of rotation given by cylinder radius r=abs(w)+.1 where w is the axis of the rotation. Modify the program to  produce a figure of rotation which approximates the shape of a drink bottle. The bottle should have (at least) a neck, and a body with a bottom. Two bottles modeled in spring 1995 are particularly elaborate. A beer bottle A vase A soda bottle Note that the form a?b:c used in a compute module is a conditional. For example, try r=0.2+(w>=0.4? Model a sphere which moves sinusoidally (that is: x(t) = A*sin(w*t+phi) ) with the end of the spring and appears to be attached to the spring. One frame of an animation is shown below. It should read \"make a 21x21 grid spanning (0,0) to (1,1)\". Be prepared to demo and explain the superquadric function, your soda bottle and spring animation. Land.",
