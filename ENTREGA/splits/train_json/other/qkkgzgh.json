Chapter 3 Sections 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5.1 3.6 To: cse461@cs Subject: Question and Answer on Wednesday Date: Mon, 22 Apr 1996 10:08:30 PDT From: Richard Ladner <ladner@whalespout.cs.washington.edu> After finishing Chapter 3 in the lecture Wednesday, there will be a question and answer session. As encouragement for you to ask questions, it is often the case that students think their questions are too simple or stupid. If you have any questions you can tell me ahead of time just e-mail and I can hopefully answer on Wednesday. To study for the final you will want to practice the kind of work that will be expected on it.
