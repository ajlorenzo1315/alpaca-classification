    "Cuerpo": "Candidate in Computer Science Expected date of graduation: Spring 1995 Area of research: Datalog programs applied to databases that satisfy functional dependencies: Datalog is a declarative query language based on first order logic. A Datalog program is a query whose input is a relational database and whose output is another database. Datalog programs are more expressive than relational queries since they can express recursive queries (for instance, the transitive closure problem is expressible in Datalog). Results obtained in datalog research can be applied to extend existing relational database managers. In this work, a graphical technique based on semantic modeling is proposed: The Semantic Model with Transactions (SMT). SMT allows for the graphical specification of objects related to a particular domain. Bachelor of Arts in Physics, March 1982 SPECIAL SKILLS College level teaching experience Computer languages: C, C++, Objectpal, QBE, SQL, Xbase Designing and implementing relational databases Experience in development of complex computer systems (200,000+ lines C code, 25 people project) Good writing and communication skills Native Spanish speaker Object-oriented analysis and design Operating systems: UNIX, MS-Windows, MS-DOS Sales experience PROFESSIONAL INTERESTS My professional interests are: applying existing technology, education, and research and development of new areas in database technology. In particular, I would like to apply my knowledge on databases and object oriented programming to information systems development. Also, I would like to work as a consultant to help end users fully exploit existing database technology. PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE New Mexico State University Las Cruces, N.M. Research assistant Research in deductive databases Developed a general purpose class library for C++. Also developed a class library for manipulating logic programs. The software was to be built using object-oriented techniques for the front end (developed using C++ under MS-Windows) and a back end database. August 1994 to January 1995 Universidad Autonoma de Cd. Headed the development of the graphical editor (over 15,000 lines of C code), the module that allows for visual integration and flow of control of the other objects in the system (such as forms, reports, and scripts). January 1989 to December 1990 Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey Monterrey, N.L. Headed the deployment (as a consultant) of accounting, inventory, and financial analysis systems in several companies January 1986 to August 1988 Microcontrol Digital, S.A. de C.V. La Paz, B.C.S. Manager Sold hardware and software for personal computers November 1984 to December 1985 Universidad Autónoma de Baja California Sur La Paz, B.C.S. Mathematics and computer science teacher Taught calculus, physics, and introduction to computers January 1983 to January 1985 TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS González-Tuchmann, A., H. J.
