The goal in a computation is to have the computer round such that the end result is as \"correct\" as possible. if there is anything other than 1000... to the right of the number of digits to be kept, then rounded in IEEE standard such that the least significant bit (to be kept) is a zero. NOTE: this is a bit different than the \"round to nearest\" algorithm (for the \"tie\" case, .5) learned in elementary school for decimal numbers. representations when a number is to small (close to 0) to be represented. value cannot be normalized (getting a 1 just to the left of the radix point would cause the exponent field to be all 0's) then underflow occurs. SW to do fl. It takes lots of shifting and masking to get the data in the right form to use integer arithmetic operations to get a result -- and then more shifting and masking to put the number back into fl. A common thing for manufacturers to do is to offer 2 versions of the same architecture, one with HW, and the other with SW fl.",
