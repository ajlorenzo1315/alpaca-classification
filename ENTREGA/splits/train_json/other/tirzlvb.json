Press the <MENU> key to start operation. The menu selection marked \"Digital Scope\" in the \"DATA\" section is used to display waveforms (<A>). A screen of reference material will be displayed on the screen when you press the <NOTES> key. Using the Oscilloscope to Examine Your Clock Generator Find the BNC connector marked \"SCOPE INPUT CH1\" on the rear of the console and connect an oscilloscope probe to it. Press <A> on the logic analyzer keypad to go to the Digital Scope Display screen. One mode brings up a reverse video cursor which allows you to change some of the setup parameters listed on the left side of the screen. You should see the clock waveform on the screen. Controlling the Display Now that you have determined how you want to sample the signal, there are several commands that change how it is displayed. As you move the cursor, the cursor position is displayed so that you can measure the time from one point on the trace to another. You can change the values of the parameters by pressing the <0> and <2> keys. Some of the settings on this screen are also accessible from the Change Setup screen. This is possible because continuous triggering uses the trigger signal to start sampling at the same point of the waveform each time. (Note: you will need to set a trigger for the oscilloscope.) > We will measure the delay of one of the 74LS04 inverters in your kit by connecting the clock generator to one input and comparing it to the output of the inverter as shown above. Adjust the triggering parameters so that both waveforms are in continuous trigger mode with the same triggering parameters. Channel two should have \"CH1\" as its triggering source so that they both start sampling at precisely the same time. What is the delay of a signal through a 74LS04 inverter? After you have done these two exercises, use the logic analyzer to observe your 3-bit counter from the previous lab assignment, using the pushbutton switch to generate the clock signal.",
