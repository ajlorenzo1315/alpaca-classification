(and we don't have to take care of our loved ones because we're all unloving sex-crazed monsters...good thing this book DID come out before aids...) a gorgeous discussion of greek society along the lines of \"if the greeks were the best that homosexuals could do and they didn't know about things like the germ theory of disease, circulation of the blood or sub-atomic particle physics, they weren't much, now were they?\" i'm also enjoying reading some essays by gore vidal about sex. cute, but lacking much motivation (\"that's nice, but why do i care that graphs with this property exist after all? i'm really really enjoying it, when i get to reading it. not that i really mind, but... i did seek out some of the following, however. vilmure also wrote life in the land of the living , which is about white trash kids in the south. scott heim wrote mysterious skin from a whole bunch of different voices, which tell us about one boy's obsession with ufo's and how he realizes that he was abused as a kid, while telling a really pretty intergenerational love story at the same time. it was also odd, now that i think about it, realizing just how much it seems different reading books about kids that were written in, say, the early 20th century versus today. other topics: i've also been reading some biography, anthropology, computer science papers, and the occasional truly bad trash novel. i read too much. here's what i generally like to read about...: consciousness, and what modern science can tell us about how the mind works. almost all that i've read on this topic is bunk too. i've been practicing witchcraft for a few years, but most books on this topic are also crap. there are good books on this. you could always read david halperin, if you wanted.",
