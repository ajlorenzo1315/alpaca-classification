    "Cuerpo": "degree in Computer Science at The University of Iowa should note that it is necessary to obtain approval for a change of status in order to continue their studies in the Ph.D. program. The Department has the following course requirements for a Ph.D. degree. Each Ph.D. student must take at least 18 semester hours of 200-level courses other than Research for Dissertation (22C:299). In addition to the above course requirements, registration in 22C:299 Research for Dissertation is, of course, part of the degree program. Section 3.3 Ph.D. Qualifying Presentation/Examination After completion of the five required 100-level courses, the Ph.D. student selects a topic for their Qualifying Presentation. The Student Committee reviews the Prospectus and the student's academic performance using the departmental standard for Ph.D. students: minimum gpa of 3.3 and completion of the five required 100-level courses with no grade below B and with at least three grades of A- or higher. Section 3.4 Ph.D. Comprehensive Examination In addition to being a Departmental examination, the Ph.D. Comprehensive Examination is required by the Graduate College. This expanded Committee is appointed as the official Ph.D. Comprehensive Examination Committee and is submitted to the Graduate College by the Chair of the Graduate Committee . 3.4.2 Conduct of the Comprehensive Examination After the student has completed most of their coursework and other preparation for their dissertation research, the student submits a status report including a proposed plan of study and a brief description of the proposed area for the dissertation research to their expanded Student Committee. At that point, an official Plan of Study and Request for the Comprehensive Examination is submitted to the Graduate College by the Chair of the Graduate Committee . This Research Committee is composed of a minimum of five members: at least four from the Department of Computer Science; at least three of these four members, including the research advisor, should have interests in the student's specialty area or in interfaces between the specialty area and other research areas; and one member from outside the Department of Computer Science. The Research Committee of a student must be approved by the Graduate Committee and is officially appointed by the Chair of the Graduate Committee when the Request for Final Examination is submitted to the Graduate College. A minor technicality is that the Graduate College requires an outside member on the Final Examination Committee but not on the Comprehensive Examination Committee. Depending upon the student's specialty area, the Research Committee may be entirely composed of computer science faculty, and then an additional outside member may be added for the dissertation proposal and the final examination. Section 3.6 Probation and Dismissal Students in the Ph.D. program must maintain a GPA of at least 3.3 in courses leading to the Ph.D. degree. The student must spend at least part of this residence in full-time involvement in his or her discipline at this University, beyond the first 24 semester hours of graduate work. If a student fails to register, he or she may not be readmitted to candidacy until submitting an application approved by his or her advisor, the Department Chair , and the Graduate Dean. Section 3.12 Application for Degree The student must file an Application for Degree with the Registrar not later than ten weeks after the start of the semester or one week after the start of the summer session in which the degree will be conferred. Students who must register for the session in which the degree is to be conferred but are away from the University campus during that session may meet this requirement by registering for independent study, research, or thesis.",
