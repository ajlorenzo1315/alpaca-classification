    "Cuerpo": "This project visualized the processes and results of a GIS analysis for simulating the distribution of nitric pollutants in a watershed in accordance with the geographic (topological) and environmental conditions. The analysis was done by a team coordinated by Prof. Stephen DeGloria of the Center for the Environment at Cornell using various GIS software packages and independently developed programs. The goal of this project is to generat a flexible prototype of visualization modules for a typical GIS work using IBM Data Explorer. One of the purposes of the data conversion is to speed up the data extraction from the two-year master hydrology or nitrogen data, otherwise, it will be time consuming to deal with different formats of different data sets. Visualization Procedures Some of the shell scripts and programs used in data conversion were extended to generate the DX input file for various data set, for example DEM.dx for importing the DEM into the DX. In addition, since the data came from different sources, they may be collected at different time, and in different cell resolutions. Hydrology and nitrogen data are colored by the colormap module of DX. The log algorithm is described below: By adopting this algorithm, the values of data will be scaled to values between 0 (if NewMin is specified as 1.0) to 1. Unfortunately, the results of this log algorithm varies with user sepecified NewMin and NewMax, therefore, different data sets need different parameters to accomplish a reasonable redistribution of the data values. The last part of the visualization procedures is to provide adjustible animation options for different scenarios. These parameters include file (data) selectors, data layer selectors, coordinate correction parameters, log algorithm parameters, display options, viewing control, etc. The DX nets generated in this project provide the analysis team an alternative to review their work in different perspectives and to present the processes and results in a more effective and understandable way. Since those DX nets were built to provide a prototype for visualizing the GIS work, they can be used to generate various displays and animations in accordance with different purposes.
