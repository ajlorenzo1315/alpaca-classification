To get to the lab you first need to be in the new part of the building with green/grey carpeting. 1350 is the first room on the left. The lab is staffed by graduate student consultants, so if you are having problems using the machines or figuring out how to do things, they are a good first line of attack. At the \"WILEY login\" prompt type \"newuser\" and press the Enter key. This starts the NEWUSER program. The NEWUSER program will ask you for your student id number, inform you of your login name, and ask you to set your password.
