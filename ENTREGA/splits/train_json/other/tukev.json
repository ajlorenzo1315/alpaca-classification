    "Cuerpo": "Overview Rivl is a language extension to Tcl/Tk for manipulating images and video sequences. The purpose of this project is to extend the set of primitives and use them for creating complex transitional effects between two images or video sequences. Deliverables A set of primitives to create transitional effects between two images or on one image by creating a sequence of intermediate images. Effects would include Flip, Deform, Squish, Peel, Fold-up, Melt, Bounce-squish, Morph(?). The same transitional effects on video sequences. Work on some of the simpler transitional effects such as Flip, Melt and Peel. Get these effects working on a single image and on transition between two images. Implementation of the other effects like Fold-up, Squish and Deform to work on both images and video sequences. Technical Overview The effects Flip : This is basically a shearing operation with a fixed line on either of the two axes. The parameters would be the position and orientation of the fulcrum, the image, and the angle through which to flip the image. In the case of flipping video, the frames would be processed one by one with the angle increasing gradually. This would involve generating a random smooth wave and shearing the image with the wave. The wave would also have to change in shape gradually so that it doesn't look like a curtain falling. How the image is to be folded can be determined by parameters to the function. The image can be folded as an opaque piece of paper or as a transparent one. Peel : This is a real cool effect - like peeling off a sheet of paper placed over another one. This effect could be extended to rolling it away like a scroll. Squish : Squishing an image would cause it to get compressed with a bulge in the middle. Bounce-squish is a variant of this where the squishing is a little springy. Deform : Deforming an image would involve squeezing a rectangular image into a nonrectangular area which could be a quadrilateral or an oval.",
