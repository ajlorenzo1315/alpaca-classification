In fact, though I web-browse less than most people, I do find lots of really interesting things from my travails, and here are some of them. You may note that there is some duplication; that's because some sites may belong to more than one category. I also decided to bias the list here slightly toward places that can serve documents quickly relative to the University of Virginia. I hope that you find this useful in your travels on the WEB. If you have any comments, suggestions, etc., please mail me at SKoga@CS.Washington.EDU. Thanks! You can also examine my current netscape links .
