Declaring Array Variables Specify the name of the array, the base type , and the number of values to store - called the size of the array. Referencing Arrays To access a particular value in an array you specify the array name and the subscript of the value (i.e. its position in the array). READ(1, 100, END=150) SCORES(3) Store values in an array using the assignment statement , just like simple variables arrayname(subscript) = value INTEGER N, SCORES(3) SCORES(N) = SCORES(N*4-5)-SCORES(1) Value of array subscript must be in the range 1 ... arraysize . Right : SCORES(N), SCORES(N*4-5) Wrong : SCORES(-13), SCORES(5), SCORES[2], SCORES(2.3) Important : The type of the array variable, the base type, and the subscript are very different. N               INTEGER Arrays and DO Loops Arrays are commonly processed using a DO loop. C     Read in all the scores C     Print out all the scores The DO loop counter COUNT is used as the array subscript to sequentially access the values one at a time. #3: Implied DO Loop Can read in any part of an array from the same line using an implied DO loop . READ *, (SCORES(I), I=50, 100) Equivalent to a DO loop inside the READ statement, so everything is read off the same line. Writing Arrays #1: DO Loop The values in an array can be printed on different lines using a DO loop. PRINT *, SCORES #3: Implied DO Loop Can print in any part of an array on the same line using an implied DO loop . PRINT *, (PRICES(NUM), NUM=1, 1000) Can read/write more than one array with an implied DO loop. 15   FORMAT(5I3) Array Arguments Arrays can be passed into and out of user-defined functions and subroutines as array arguments . As with passing simple variables as arguments, array variables must first be declared in the main program. C     Finds the highest value in the list PRINT *, FACT(SCORES(3)) Output Array Arguments If an array is an output argument (i.e. passed back to the main program) then the array values can and must be changed.",
