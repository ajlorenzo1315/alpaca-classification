    "Cuerpo": "My name is Dan Hung. I was born in Taipei, Taiwan and had spent my childhood there until my family moved to the U.S. in the early eighties. One of my greatest interest during my childhood is computers. Indeed, soon after arriving in the States my father bought me a Commodore-64 as a birthday present. Computers and I hit it off pretty well and I ended up spending most of my teenage years adapting to my new homeland and messing with various computers. Until my college years, my family and I lived in New York City. Despite being brought up as a city-kid, I hated New York - it's dirty, unfriendly, expensive, and crime-ridden. So when I had the chance to go somewhere else I took it and ended up in upstate New York, at Cornell University. Now, I love Ithaca very much during the non-winter seasons. The winters here, however, drives me nuts. It's always snow, sleet, rain, ice, salt, dirt, etc. ARRRGGGGHHHHH! I had wanted to major in Computer Science when I started my Bachelor degree, but changed my mind during my freshman year. The flexible ORIE curriculum at Cornell enabled me to take a large number of courses in things I am interested in, ranging from computer graphics to economics, from history to small business consulting. At the same time, I also had experiences in starting my own company, working for a large company, and serving as a consultant to a local business. It was perhaps because I was emotionally shattered, or that I was just greedy, that I took the highest paying job I could find. I ended up working on Wall Street after completing my bachelor degree. I must admit that I made a dreadful mistake in working on Wall Street. Even though the money is good, the environment is bad: filled with politics, rude people, and infighting. Eventaully I realized that money is not everything and decided to focus on doing something I enjoy and at an environment that I like.",
