The down-side is that no textbook is available to complement the course. The material presented in class will however be complemented with conference and journal papers. Weekly problem sets will provide an opportunity to let the material presented in class ''sink in''. Accounts on the NCSA CM-5 for this purpose should be available shortly. I am also purchasing a small cluster of SPARCstation-20's connected by an ATM network which I hope to make available by the end of september. This platform will be significantly more shaky than the CM-5, but it will offer the opportunity to dig much deeper into the system. The basic mindset you should have is that you are writing for an upcoming conference. The relative weighting of synthesis and analysis depends on your preferences but neither should have zero weight. Design studies are great; so is gathering relevant facts. In my view this is an ''advanced topics'' course intended to provide food for thought. At the end of the course you will have the opportunity to present your project to the entire class (and others in the department) in a poster session: each group prepares a 3'x4' poster with text and diagrams explaining the project. Prerequisites Basic familiarity with parallel computing (message passing, data parallel, shared memory programming models) OR basic familiarity with computer systems (processor pipeline, assembly language, memory hierarchy, virtual memory system, thread packages, system calls) This course will require significant breadth knowledge. Not everyone is expected to know everything. Problem sets and projects will be done in groups. ), you are welcome to the course. Grading The problem sets and the term project will be done in groups of two and you must choose a different partner for each of the three first problem sets. The problem sets are graded: I expect you to take a serious crack at each of the problems and to turn-in a well-rounded solution for one problem per set. The final grade will roughly be composed of: 40% problem sets, 40% project report, 10% project presentation, 10% class participation. Return to CS 617 Home Page",
