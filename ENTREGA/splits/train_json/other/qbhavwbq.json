    "Cuerpo": "The Fair will be run in the spirit of a local science fair, and students may enter any project that has relevance to computer science. The intention of the Fair is to enourage students to work on independent projects and to give them a public showplace for projects demonstrating their creativity and originality. Finally, we will use the Fair as a tool for increasing the visibility of our students with potential employers and potential graduate departments. The Fair will be held using two mediums -- the web and a poster session. In order to submit a project, a website should be constructed containing a short abstract describing the project, and any longer description and summary of results, pictures or demos that the team wishes to display. Websites for all projects will be linked up to a single website that is accessible from the CS department's homepage. Outstanding projects may be highlighted by the department via additional links from the department's homepage in order to showplace examples of what Cornell undergraduates do. We will also be having a poster session in which all the entries will be physically displayed to the general public for one afternoon. One member of the team of entrants should be on hand at all times to describe the project. For those that wish to, we will allow the entrants to to bring in a personal computer in order to give demonstrations of projects. We will be able to provide power but no networking capabilities. Some possibilites include (but are not limited to): An interesting extension/enhancement of a project turned in for a CS course. A result of an independent research project. Especially encouraged:  A project that does not fall within the scope of any one course - e.g., a computer game that takes illustrates an interesting CS aspect,  an interesting tool for the web (for examples, visit the MIT Media Lab ),  since artists seem to be on the cutting edge of using computers  in new ways, one might produce a new tool for generating artwork (if you happen to be in NYC, you might want to stop by the ``Mediascape'' exhibit at the Guggenheim SoHo for ideas - alternately, there are several web sites that are of interest, one example is the artnetweb -- note the list of CS companies that sponsor that page), Elegibility: Any Cornell undergrad may enter the contest. If the project is done as part of an on ongoing Cornell research project, then it is crucial that you clarify the exact contribution of your work in relation to the contributions of persons that are not part of the project team. No faculty sponsorship is required. We reserve the right to exclude projects that we feel do not comply with the above criteria. Important Dates: Firm dates will be announced at a later date.
