    "Cuerpo": "You will use the ideas that you have read about, and apply these to a different environment. The computer that you are thinking about will have some interesting characteristics. There will be many CPU's sharing the same memory (see figure below). This computer will support parallel programs consisting of many processes cooperating in a single computation. Second, it will have a large physical memory. You are to describe how the Working Set concept can help to efficiently allocate the memory and CPU's in this workstation design. There are two areas that you will address. First, how can you use the concept of Working Set to efficiently execute parallel programs. How do you define the last referenced time for a page shared by many processes? Do applications with extremely large memory demands change the way we allocate memory? You paper will make design decisions that may require data about the type of programs that will run on the workstation and how these programs will behave. You should describe what information you need and how you will go about collecting the information to make these design decisions. You should also describe how you will verify these decisions and how you will set the parameters of the various policies that you design. What are the significant differences of this new computer from ones that we have read about? Can you use solutions from the past or will you satisfy these goals in new ways? It is not a description of the paper. It should be complete enough to understand what will be covered in the paper. Body: This is the main part of the paper. This is a discussion of what the reader should have learned from the paper. Your paper must have figures.",
