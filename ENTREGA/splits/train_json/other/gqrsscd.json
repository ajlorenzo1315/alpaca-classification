Jeffrey Mahoney Ph.D. Thesis, Department of Computer Sciences, University of Texas at Austin, May, 1996. This research describes the system RAPTURE, which is designed to revise rule bases expressed in certainty-factor format. A modified version of backpropagation is used to adjust the certainty factors of the rules, ID3's information-gain heuristic is used to add new rules, and the Upstart algorithm is used to create new hidden terms in the rule base. Results on refining four real-world rule bases are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of this combined approach. While the problem of learning a Bayesian network, given complete data, has been explored in some depth, the problem of learning networks with unobserved causes is still open. In this proposal, we view this problem from the perspective of theory revision and present a novel approach which adapts techniques developed for revising theories in symbolic and connectionist representations. Our technique inductively revises the network to fit the data better. Our proposed system has two components: one component revises the parameters of a Bayesian network of known structure, and the other component revises the structure of the network. The component for parameter revision maps the given Bayesian network into a multi-layer feedforward neural network, with the parameters mapped to weights in the neural network, and uses standard backpropagation techniques to learn the weights. We will also discuss our proposed structure revision algorithm, our plans for experiments to evaluate the system, as well as some extensions to the system. The problem of learning Bayesian networks with hidden variables is known to be a hard problem. In this paper, we present an approach that learns the conditional probabilities on a Bayesian network with hidden variables by transforming it into a multi-layer feedforward neural network (ANN). (ML-94) This paper compares two methods for refining uncertain knowledge bases using propositional certainty-factor rules. The first method, implemented in the RAPTURE system, employs neural-network training to refine the certainties of existing rules but uses a symbolic technique to add new rules. The second method, based on the one used in the KBANN system, initially adds a complete set of potential new rules with very low certainty and allows neural-network training to filter and adjust these rules. Modifying Network Architectures For Certainty-Factor Rule-Base Revision J. Jeffrey Mahoney and Raymond J. Mooney Proceedings of the International Symposium on Integrating Knowledge and Neural Heuristics 1994 , pp. (ISIKNH-94) This paper describes RAPTURE --- a system for revising probabilistic rule bases that converts symbolic rules into a connectionist network, which is then trained via connectionist techniques. (Special issue on Architectures for Integrating Neural and Symbolic Processing) This paper describes Rapture --- a system for revising probabilistic knowledge bases that combines connectionist and symbolic learning methods.

Results on two real-world domains demonstrate that this combined approach performs as well or better than previous methods.",
