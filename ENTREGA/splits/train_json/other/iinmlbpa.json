Three villages belong to it, which are called Benifairo and Simat to which \"de Valldigna\" is added. Tavernes de Valldigna is the half-official capital and the only one with a district reaching down to the shore where an important centre of apartment blocks has been built. The valley is one of the most peaceful places. At Simat, a visit should include the Royal Monastery of La Valldigna, an architectural treasure of the 14th Century. Its inland boundaries are the mountains of La Safor, which is 1,011m high and after which the region is named, and El Montdúver Peak (841m). Gandia is unquestionably the capital of La Safor. Very early prehistoric traces give an idea of the art and personality of the first cave dwellers of El Parpalló, Negra and El Forat de l´Aire. In Roman times, people began to come down from the heights and settle on the plain, which explains the traces of civilisations at Ador, Beniartjo and other places. In Muslim times, the castles at Bairén, Rótova and Almisserat were important defensive structures. Famous writers Joanot Martorell (Tirant Lo Blanch) and Ausiàs March (Antologia Poètica) were born in this beautiful city. : Borja) family, the 4th duke of whom is canonised as Frances Borgia. In the 16th Century, Gandia receives the title of University. Its church, raised to the dignity of Collegiate Church by a Borgia pope (Alexander VI) was begun in the 14th Century and is one of the most outstanding examples of Valencia Gothic. Despite many alterations, the ducal palace still preserves the Borgia style and houses many objects reminiscent of the saint. The surrounding of Gandia should be visited by making very interesting basic excursions, such as the one from el Parpalló to Montdúver along a regional road through La Marxuquera as far as La Drova Valley; the one through La Safor visiting Almoines, Beniartjo, Potries and Villalonga, and the one of Rótova through Alfahuir for a visit of the 14th Century former Monastery of San Jerónimo de Cotalba, which is the most interesting in the whole region. It has a magnificent beach which links up with those of Piles, Bellreguart, Daimús and Miramar in the north and extends as far the mouth of the River Molinell in the south, which is the boundary of the Province of Alicante and an area which once belonged to El Castillo de Rebollet, a mainly agricultural community where the monumental neo-Classical Archpriestly Church of Sant Maria la Mayor and San Roque Church - once a mosque - stand out. In all four seasons, the whole of the Valencia coast is an inviting place because of its magnificent climatic conditions. Text extracted from Tourist Office of Spain.
