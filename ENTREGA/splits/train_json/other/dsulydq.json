Martin (milo@cs.wisc.edu) Program 0 Due Wednesday, September 11, 1996 Objective: Program 0 is designed to give you practice editing, compiling, executing, modifying, and documenting a program. Before doing this assignment you may want to some review the help documents from the CS302 home page , such as the introduction to Microsoft Windows and Borland C++ . To do this, start the File Manager , select the Copy... option from the File menu. Do problem 1-1, page 33 (chapter 1, problem 1):  Enter and run the program from Display 1.8, on page 21 of the text. When entering the program, pay close attention to the indentation of the lines of the program. Add header documentation (comments at the top of a source file) which contains the program title and number, your name, section, instructor, etc. Any characters on a line after // is a comment, and words between /* */ are also comments. Borland C++ 4.5 Hints Start Borland C++ 4.5 which is found in the CSApps program group. When you have Borland up and running, you want to first create a file to write your program in. You click on File in the left corner of the screen, and choose New within the menu that drops down. The first time you save it, choose Save as within the File menu. Click on the folders in the box on the right so that you will be saving the file in \"U:\\PROGRAMS\\PROG0\" . For the name of the file, enter \"PROG0.CPP\" . The .CPP lets you know that it is a C++ source file. The second time you save, you can just choose Save , and it will be done automatically. To access a file that you have previously saved to the disk, simply choose Open from the File menu, changing to the desired folder, and then selecting the file. Your program will be compiled, linked, and run. If you made a typing error, chances are you will get a syntax error. Go back to the program, check your typing, and when the mistake is found, change it and run the program again. When the program runs, it will create a window, and prompt you for the program input.",
