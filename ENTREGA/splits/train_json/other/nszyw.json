Il Postino The BEST I have seen since I came to the States. I saw Kevin Costner's first but I don't know which is made first. The Three Muskiteers Duma's story itself was just an entertainment story so I don't expect more from this movie. A good comedy and not bad as a Tuesday Movie. Gentleman's Agreement Perhaps it's too old for me to like it. He only wanted to say \"I love you\" to his girlfriend. Three Colors: White White has a clearer plot than the other two although it is just the same weird. I still prefer Red among the three which is the first one I saw. Gandhi Not good as a movie but as a historical fact. The plot was just a combination of Jurassic Park and Frankenstein but was still thrilling. The most remarkable thing is not the story itself but the issue it raised: what will become after man is able to create human? Dr. Moreau couldn't answer. Marlon Brando is perhaps the best actor to play such god-like role. Another actor is noteworthy, who played the eyewitness of the island. Maybe it is the only thing that is not bad. Like Emma , it is a romantic comedy. Looks like a low budget movie but the stupid thing is the microphone appeared in the screen! The plot isn't perfect but the acting was grrrrreat!",
