    "Cuerpo": "Content-based image retrieval is the semantic analysis and retrieval of images. Features representing the objects might be either primitive or logical features. The summary data is based on feature vectors: Since in content based visual databases, all items (images or objects) are represented by pre-computed visual features, the key attribute for each image will be a feature vector which corresponds to a point in a multi-dimensional feature space; and search will be based on similarities between the feature vectors. The user submits a query in the form of a prototype image and the system uses the feature vector(s) of the appropriate query class(es). CBIR systems provide support for multiple query classes. For color histograms, many different extraction methods are used. The first issue is the dimension of the color feature vector, e.g., the number of colors. The QBIC system [12] uses a 64 or 256 dimension color histogram where each i -th element is the percentage of color i . User Interface I defined a simple user interface for color histogram queries and provided the ability to query by example using color histograms and shapes. This function is used by the AnalysisManager to process a user request to add an image to the database. The Pixmap class provides an interface to a color pixel representation of an image ( pixmap.h ). Analysis Manager The Analysis Manager, analmgr.h performs analysis on images as they are added to the system. The result is a set of feature vectors, one for each type of query class. One way to do this is to provide a hierarchy of queries in which the results of one level of queries are passed to a different similarity function. The Query By Color dialog allows the user to specify up to 3 color percentages for the query. The Image Feature Histogram is the histogram of the feature vector. This function is responsible for creating a query class specific feature vector and installing it in the Image . For the data I used, 9.0 to 24.0 worked for three color queries and 25.0 to 40.0 was good for query by example. Color Queries There are two ways to query the database by color: dialog and example. These methods must support queries composed of multiple query classes.",
