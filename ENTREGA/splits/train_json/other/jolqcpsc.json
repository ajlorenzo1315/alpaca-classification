Yu and C. R. Dyer, in Advances in Image Understanding: A Festschrift for Azriel Rosenfeld , IEEE Computer Society Press, Los Alamitos, Ca., 1996, 177-193. It is shown that given a marked point on a stationary contour, an active observer can move deterministically to the osculating plane for that point by observing and controlling the deformation of the projected contour. We present an approach for recovering surface shape from the occluding contour using an active (i.e., moving) observer. It is based on a relation between the geometries of a surface in a scene and its occluding contour: If the viewing direction of the observer is along a principal direction for a surface point whose projection is on the contour, surface shape (i.e., curvature) at the surface point can be recovered from the contour. We present an approach for recovering a global surface model of an object from the deformation of the occluding contour using an active (i.e., mobile) observer able to control its motion. In particular, we consider two problems: (1) How can the observer's viewpoint be controlled in order to generate a dense sequence of images that allows incremental reconstruction of an unknown surface, and (2) how can we construct a global surface model from the generated image sequence? We achieve the first goal by purposefully and qualitatively controlling the observer's instantaneous direction of motion in order to control the motion of the visible rim over the surface. We show how global model-building can be achieved for generic objects of arbitrary shape by controlling the camera's motion on automatically-selected surface tangent and normal planes so that the boundary of the already-reconstructed regions is guaranteed to \"slide\" over the object's entire surface. ( postscript or 10K gzip'ed postscript ) We consider the following problem: How should an observer change viewpoint in order to generate a dense image sequence of an arbitrary smooth surface so that it can be incrementally reconstructed using the occluding contour and the epipolar parameterization? ( postscript or 110K gzip'ed postscript ) We present a viewing strategy for exploring the surface of an unknown object (i.e., making all of its points visible) by purposefully controlling the motion of an active observer. We show that this leads to an object exploration strategy in which the observer purposefully controls its motion based on the occluding contour in order to impose structure on the set of surface points explored, make its representation simple and qualitative, and provably solve the exploration problem for smooth generic surfaces of arbitrary shape. ( postscript or 250K gzip'ed postscript ) A new technique is presented for computing 3D scene structure from point and line features in monocular image sequences. ( postscript or 290K gzip'ed postscript ) In this paper we present the geometry and the algorithms for organizing a viewer-centered representation of the occluding contour of polyhedra. The contour is computed from a polyhedral boundary model as it would appear under orthographic projection into the image plane from every viewpoint on the view sphere. The results we show from an experimental system demonstrate that features of the occluding contour can be computed in a model-based framework, and and their geometry constrains the viewpoints from which a model will project to a set of occluding contour features in an image. ( postscript or 80K gzip'ed postscript ) In this paper we present the geometry and the algorithms for organizing and using a viewer-centered representation of the occluding contour of polyhedra. ( postscript or 460K gzip'ed postscript ) A fundamental problem common to both computer graphics and model-based computer vision is how to efficiently model the appearance of a shape. This thesis presents a viewer-centered representation that is based on the visual event, a viewpoint where a specific change in the structure of the projected model occurs. on Computer Vision , 1993, 542-545. ( postscript or 60K gzip'ed postscript ) In order to develop a foundation for visualization, we develop lattice models for data objects and displays that focus on the fact that data objects are approximations to mathematical objects and real displays are approximations to ideal displays.",
