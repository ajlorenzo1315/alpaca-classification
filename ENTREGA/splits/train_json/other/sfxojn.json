Specifying a Problem In order to start a new planning session, select New Session from the Debugger menu. VCR Display a trace of the current session. Once the user has seleted a session in the Plan System Overview Window, they can create a VCR Window for that session either by selecting New VCR Window from the Debug menu, or by pressing the VCR button in the window itself. Anatomy of the Search Tree Most of the VCR Window is taken up by a graphical depiction of the planning trace in the form of a tree (we will refer to this as either the planning tree or the search tree). Each node in the tree is a partial plan; the root node plan contains only the start and goal states, while each subsequent generation represents one application of the UCPOP algorithm. You can solve some of these problems by changing or restricting the display of various nodes in the tree via the Tree and Options menus. If the cursor is already at this node, PDB will open a plan window on that node. All Nodes Display all nodes in the tree. Expand Node Display the children of the current plan. Individual plan display The Plan Window Clicking on a selected node produces a Plan Window, which provides a more detailed view of the plan associated with that node. The plan can be viewed in one of two ways: in textual format the plan is printed in the same way that the results of planning are returned by UCPOP, while in graphic format the steps are drawn in a partial order from left to right, with lines representing links connecting effects with preconditions. It also allows you to navigate the planning tree simply by selecting any of these nodes: the Plan Window will immediately update itself using the node you selected as the new current node. Moving the Plan Window from the VCR Whenever a Plan Window is opened, a unique ID number is assigned to it and drawn next to the node in the VCR Window at which it is pointing. Text Textual View Verbosity Control detail or representation Verbose Print out conditions and steps fully Terse Show only steps Mouse Commands Plan Tree Nodes L Select Node Pressing the left button on a node causes the window to display the plan associated with that node. Mouse Commands L Select Object Clicking on an item in one of the browser menus will bring up the menu associated with that item(if any) in the pane to the right of the selection, as well as the object associated with that item(if any). Set the Search Control Options Using the New Session dialog, set the search function to ucpop::bf-control . This is the same search function used for this problem in the previous example. This will bring up a VCR Window. If the planner is very similar to UCPOP,  only functions specific to the planner need to be redefined.",
