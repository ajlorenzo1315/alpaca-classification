    "Cuerpo": "Advantages of reusing these existing materials are avoiding the duplicated effort of creating new versions of material that is already in existence, using up-to-date information, and letting the student see the original source materials. Once the set of appropriate materials has been selected the student is confronted with the navigation problem: given the set of appropriate materials, where should the student start? There are four major components that make up the Wtutor environment: the Wtutor program, the Tmosaic program, a tutorial map and the World Wide Web. Tmosaic provides the interface to the World Wide Web; it is used to retrieve Web documents and display those documents to the student or tutorial author. A socket and corresponding message protocol were added to NCSA Mosaic so that Wtutor could communicate with Tmosaic. Tmosaic notifies Wtutor of events such as retrieval of a URL, submission of a form, and student requests such as Next URL . In the Wtutor environment, the primary role of the tutorial author is to create the tutorial map. The author must still find or create URLs to include in the tutorial; for this task the author can use tools such as the MetaCrawler to find URLs that may be appropriate. The tutorial author can add or delete URLs from the tutorial map using Wtutor. The author can either specify a fully qualified URL, or retrieve the URL using Tmosaic and then specify that that URL should be added to the tutorial map. The author also specifies precedence information in the tutorial map. This precedence information is used by Wtutor to determine the sequence in which the URLs and assessment points of the tutorial should be viewed. The author can also identify alternative URLs; that is, if URL A and URL B are alternatives, the student would not need to view B if the student had already viewed A. Wtutor uses the information it receives from Tmosaic to track the students progress through the tutorial map. Wtutor specifies that a link to a URL should be highlighted when the URL is included in the tutorial map and all precedence requirements for that URL have been met. The tutorial author can specify the highlight  color to be used. If the student does not have a highlighted link on the currently displayed link, the student can have Wtutor select the next URL to visit. When the student selects the Next option, Wtutor finds a URL that is ready to visit. Wtutor looks first for a consequent of the current URL; if there are none that are acceptable then consequents of the previous URL visited are checked. Finally, Wtutor looks for any URL within the map whose precedence requirements have all been met. If all URLs within the tutorial map have been viewed, the student is notified that the tutorial has been completed.",
