    "Cuerpo": "Since every instruction takes at least one memory access (for the instruction fetch), the performance of computer is dominated by its memory access time. Locality in space (spacial locality) if data has been referenced recently, then data nearby (in memory) is likely to be referenced soon. The elements of an array are neighbors in memory, and are likely to be referenced one after the other. This faster memory is called a CACHE. If the data is in the cache, then we have a HIT. The data is handed over to the CPU, and the memory access is completed. If the data is not in the cache, then we have a MISS. if the tag is not present or the VALID bit is not active, then there is a MISS, and the block must be loaded from memory. the cache is smaller than main memory, so not all blocks are in the cache. more on data dependencies ------------------------- what happens to a pipeline in the case of branch instructions? BRANCHES and PIPELINING ----------------------- (or, how to minimize the effect of control dependencies on pipelines.) If the incorrect instruction is currently in the pipe, (meaning that the branch was taken), then all instructions currently in the pipe subsequent to the branch must be BACKED OUT. the number of holes in the case of a branch. The mechanism: Have the effect of a branch (the change of the PC) be delayed until a subsequent instruction. This means that the instruction following a branch is executed independent of whether the branch is to be taken or not. is turned into the following by a MIPS assembler: add $8, $9, $10 beq $3, $4,  label nop                  # really a pipeline hole, the DELAY SLOT move $18, $5 . This code can be rearranged only if there are no data dependencies between the branch and the add instructions. squashing A fancy name for branch prediction that always presumes the branch will be taken,  and keeps a copy of the PC that will be needed in the case of backing out. The fraction of time spent in that part of the code is f. The speedup of that part of the code (f) is S.",
