The Answers What is Collaborative Filtering? What is GroupLens? GroupLens is a collaborative filtering system that helps you work together with other people to find the quality news articles out of the huge volume of news articles generated every day. To accomplish this the GroupLens system combines your opinions about articles you have already read with the opinions of others who have done likewise and gives you a personalized prediction for each unread news article. Once it has found for you some people you agree with it tells you, in the form of a prediction, what they thought of the article. You can use this prediction to help you decide whether or not you want to read the article. But, one of the interesting characteristics of collaborative filtering systems is that the more people that use a system, the better the system works. Why don't you support all newsgroups? If you really want to have GroupLens support your favorite newsgroup, just find some other people on that newsgroup who are willing to read and rate the articles. If you can give me a list of users who will promise to use grouplens, I'll add support for it. What is a pseudonym, and why do I need one? GroupLens combines these two pieces of information for all the available ratings for this article to come up with a prediction. Another reason why some articles are not rated is that you are the first GroupLens user to rate the article. The nice thing about GroupLens is that the more people we get to participate, the less frequently that will happen to you. How do I decide what to rate an article? This article is bad This article is OK This article is good This article is great, I'd like to see more like this one!",
