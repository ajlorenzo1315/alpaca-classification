    "Cuerpo": "Introduction Object tracking in a sequence of images can provide a base for a multitude of digital video processing applications such as removal of object in the scene. Using the existing object-tracking feature in RiVL , we implement a semi-automated application that allows the user to specify and remove an object, then reconstruct the background to result in a new video sequence. We  reconstruct the background and use different techniques for segmentation as illustrated in the diagram below. [Key words: object-tracking, Hausdorff distance, object-removal, segmentation, background reconstruction, image filtering ] <-- Table of Contents 2. Background Information RiVL RiVL is a resolution independent video language which has video and audio as first class data types. Taking advantage of the fact that the motion of the object is roughly an affine transformation between any two consecutive frames, the algorithm matches all the possible translations and scales of the model to a specified search window (shown as a red dotted box in Figure 2). Figure  2: Hausdorff tracking algorithm explained <-- Background Information <-- Table of Contents 3. 2 Background Reconstruction We need the background to replace the tracked object from the original sequence and to possibly segment the object. We experiment with three different approaches to background reconstruction: a temporal median filter, a temporal mean filter, and a physical space search. The first two approaches for the background reconstruction are temporal mean filter and the temporal median filter. Temporal Mean Filter (TMEF) The TMEF technique computes the mean pixel value by taking the arithmetic average of the whole frame sequence and assigns this result to the pixels in the background frame. Physical Space Search Physical space search finds the frame where the bounding box of the tracked object does not overlap with the one in the currently processed frame, that is the part of background needed to replace the object is the one that has not been occupied by the object in the previous frames. If we assume a single moving object in the sequence, then it is possible to use one frame which has the object removed and the background reconstructed as the background for the entire sequence. 3 Object Segmentation Image Segmentation Segmentation, or separating the tracked object from the background, is one of the core problems in vision that has yet to be adequately solved for unconstrained settings. With second differencing, we perform a binary AND operation on the difference image of the first two frames and the last two frames to segment out the moving object in the middle frame. Evaluation Figure 5: Input video sequence We used the above video sequence of 200 frames as one of the inputs for our test. The reconstructed background image from the mean filter has a slightly visible blurring effect caused by the moving object. Motion differencing performed the worst since it tends to give an irregular outline of the motion and includes portion of the background which belongs to the object in the previous image but not in the current image: this effect appears as an undesirable white outline around the object in the right pair of images below. Figure 5: Segmentation results for second differencing, and motion differencing We set out with a two-fold goal, one of object-removal and the other of object-segmentation. Although tracking and object-segmentation are active ares of research in vision, there appears to be virtually no established work on automating object removal using background reconstruction.",
