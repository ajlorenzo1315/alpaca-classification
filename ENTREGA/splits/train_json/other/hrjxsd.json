    "Cuerpo": "It is important to understand that HTML is designed to specify the structure of the document, and not its visual appearance, because while you might like for your document to show up in 12-point Times, double spaced, with 2 inch margins on all sides, those kinds of decisions will be made not by you, but by the person reading your document. The tags themselves are made up of <, the tag name, and >. With attributes, a tag might be used like this: <IMG SRC=\"os.gif\" ALIGN=\"top\"> Structure of an HTML file All HTML files should follow this general format: <HTML> This is the body, or main text, of the document. </HTML> The first tag, <HTML> , indicates that the contents of the file are, in fact, in HTML format. This title is usually displayed at the top of the screen: for example, this document's title is \"An Introduction to HTML\". In the example above, I could have written (for example) <HTML> <HEAD><TITLE>This is the title of the document.</TITLE></HEAD> <BODY>This is the body, or main text, of the document.</BODY> </HTML> and gotten the same result. The emphasis was not on using HTML correctly, but on creating documents that looked good in Mosaic, which is very forgiving of bad HTML. For example: <P> This is the first paragraph. This HTML is rendered as: This is the first paragraph. You can, of course, use a section level tag more than once in a document. In general, it is best to use <EM> and <STRONG> , since they give good results on all browsers. To make an ordered list, use the <OL> (ordered list) and <LI> (list item) tags, like this: <OL> <LI>Get two slices of bread, peanut butter, and jelly. In fact, they can be as long as you want, and can even have multiple paragraphs. This is an example of some really long items in a list. By itself, the <IMG> tag does nothing; you must use the SRC=\"\" attribute in the tag to specify the name of the image. Like the <IMG> tag, <A> does nothing by itself. As you can see, the text inside the <A> and </A> tags is marked as a link. <VAR> Variable names Other Sources of Information By now, you should have a good idea of what HTML is all about, and you should be able to create your own HTML documents.
