We have CD1 , CD2 and TAPE to play music On the Mixer you use CD1 for CD1 , BOX CD2 for CD2 and TAPE for the (lower) double tape deck. When you program, be ready to adjust the volume if you are on the floor. How to program CD2 This is the 5-disc player. Put in 5 cd's. Press program , then press one of the disc buttons on the left, then press the track number on the right (if # > 10 then press >10 and the two digits. How to change cd's and program when music is playing Press exchange to open the slide. Put in the cd you want. Then program as before. When you start DJ-ing you can never do wrong by playing songs that are marked ++. So play those a lot. When you start picking more of your own music, be aware of the following. It often happened to me that a song that I liked very much at home did not work at all on the dance floor. For example I could play: 1J : 1LH : 1WC : 1J : 1LH : 1WC : 1LH : 1WC : ... etc Play for the People Try to play what people like. Do not tire people to play fast songs in a row Also there are a lot of beginners at the dances (especially early in the evening). I normally play only a few songs over 200 a night. This is als the case for WC. If there is a great song that you would like in it entire length then consider having people change partners several times so people do not have to dance with the same partner for a long time. Then, when you want people to change partners lower the music and announce the change (make sure that people are really changing partners; they normally do not hear you). Therefore a DJ should always monitor the sound level at the start of each song.",
