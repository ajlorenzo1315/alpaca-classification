The first thing here is to find a way to represent the problem and the operators (including operators which will be added as problems are solved), so that programming will be as simple as possible. So, you are going to be given a set of initial identities (in standard form) and you will have to write a lisp program to select the \"best\" transformation identity for a given problem identity. You will be given a list of identities which can be used as transforms, and one or more identities as problem identities. You should write three functions; one for each of the three heuristic methods defined below. Each function will then have to select the \"best\" transform identity to be first applied in solving the problem (ie in proving that the left side of the problem identity can be transformed into its right side). Here the transform identity AA +  BB  =  1  can be applied to the left side of the problem, P, and the simplification score is 4 (there are 5 symbols on T's left side, including the + sign, and one symbol on T's right side). Your program has to print out the scores for all of the T identities, for the given problem/s, and the identification numbers of the T identities. The transform identities will be the first 16 identities in the list (Table I) given out in Packet #1. You will use a list of these numbers to indicate the \"familiarity score\" of the transform identities. The transform identity chosen here will be the one closest to the head of the list, which can be applied to the left side of the problem identity. This one is more complex and is supposed to provide a score, called E, which is a measure of the applicability of either the left or right sides of the T identity to the left side of the P identity, and also the degree to which the T identity is likely to make the left side of the P identity more like the right side of the P identity. Make a feature set for the left side of P, the right side of P, the left side of each T and the right side of each T. (The T feature sets will already be available). This will be w = sum of symbols in the feature. the feature set for the left side of P with the corresponding weight for each feature. The E score is computed by adding together the weights of all features present in T with each weight multiplied by a \"desirablity-factor\", d, which is intended to show if the single feature associated with a given w is going to help or hinder finding a solution. To find di, there are various possibilities, a feature could be in the left side of T and not in the right side of T, and it could be in the left side of P and not in the right side of P. This situation will be described by  1 0 1 0 This is a very desirable situation, since applying the left side of T to the left side of P will remove a feature from the left side of P, and this feature is not in the right side of P, so this T will help solve the problem. The features from T will be scored one at a time, giving for A the situation is  1 0 1 0  here w = 1 and d = +4 so the A feature adds +4 to E When the feature 1 is considered, it is 0 1 0 0 so d = -1 and this contributes -1 to E so the effectiveness score, E, for applying this T to this P Find the best T identity , using each of the three above heuristics separately, for each of the following identities:-",
