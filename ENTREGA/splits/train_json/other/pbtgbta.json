    "Cuerpo": "a. If (or when) you are signed up for credit, please also send mail to Tompa saying how you intend to satisfy the number of credits you chose, so that we know who are the notetakers, who is doing a project, etc. Would it be o.k. for either you or me to send this to the class list, cse590bi@cs? Date: Fri, 12 Jan 1996 12:14:48 PST From: Martin Tompa <tompa@geoduck.cs.washington.edu> If you have signed up for credit and haven't yet sent me the following information, please do so now: > email: egan@u.washington.edu > > To: cse590bi@geoduck Subject: CSE 590 BI projects Date: Thu, 08 Feb 1996 16:28:36 PST From: Martin Tompa <tompa@geoduck.cs.washington.edu> If you are going to do a project in CSE 590BI, please send me mail with your schedule for next week (Feb 12-16). To: cse590bi@geoduck Subject: some course project suggestions Date: Fri, 09 Feb 1996 10:44:24 PST From: Martin Tompa <tompa@geoduck.cs.washington.edu> Here are a few project ideas for CSE 590BI, to get you thinking about them. Computational Molecular Biology We are pleased to announce that the DOE Office of Health and Environmental Research, Human Genome Program has generously provided some financial support for graduate students and postdocs to attend the 2nd SNL Workshop on Computational Molecular Biology. http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/590bi/ To: cse590bi@geoduck Subject: sequel to CSE 590BI Date: Tue, 27 Feb 1996 15:50:47 PST From: Martin Tompa <tompa@geoduck.cs.washington.edu> We are considering holding a less formal sequel to CSE 590BI next quarter, to explore some of the many topics that we couldn't get into deeply enough this quarter. Martin, Here is an announcement for a course next quarter that may interest you or people attending your class last quarter. ------- End of Forwarded Message Date: 27 Mar 1996 09:32 PST From: Larry Ruzzo <ruzzo@quinault.cs.washington.edu> To: cse590bi@cs, cs-grads@cs Cc: baker@ben.bchem.washington.edu Subject: CSE590BI schedule change We suspect that many people who would be interested in the continuation of our computational bio seminar will also be interested in David Baker's seminar on protein structure prediction. The conference will be held at DIMACS and Princeton University, May 17-19, 1996. The Theoretical Biology Group (T10) at Los Alamos National Laboratory invites applications for a Graduate Research Assistantship. > tim hunkapiller > --------------------------------------------------------------------- > > > David Haussler, from the Computer Science Department at University of > California Santa Cruz, will be visiting the Center for Molecular > Biotechnology Tuesday June 4 and will be presenting a lecture: > > Using Hidden Markov Models for Biosequence Analysis > (abstract at end of email) > > Dr. Haussler received Ph.D. in computer science in 1982 from > U.

Next week Phil will do a bit more on sequence assembly, then I will describe some approaches to \"biomolecular computation\", e.g. the work of Adleman, using DNA technology to solve an NP-complete problem. Please let me know if you are interested in the course but would be unable to attend at that time (unfortunately though there aren't many alternative times that wouldn't cause problems for somebody). a. This is the last message that will be Cc'd to cse590bi@cs.",
