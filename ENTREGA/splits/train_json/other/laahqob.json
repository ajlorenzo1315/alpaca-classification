    "Cuerpo": "I'd like to take some time and think up new ideas. Intel has eaten a whole slew of the ideas that I had stored up when I came out of my M.S., and working at Intel gives you very little opportunity for the type of deep though that I, at least, need to come up with good ideas. I am very much afraid that, if I do not go back to school, I will reproduce the job path of many of the people I see around me at Intel - some of whom are Fellows - who are now idea consumers, instead of idea generators. I want to work on one or two more chips, after P6, but then I would like to have the opportunity to \"retire\" to a university. But at least, after 10 years in industry, I have probably proven that I am not one of \"Those who can, do; those who can't teach\" if I decide to become a professor. Deal was, she could apply for jobs anyplace in the U.S. she wanted, so long as there was a good computer architecture school for me to do my Ph.D. at. (There was a hidden aspect to my research that I didn't understand when I was there, but which was later explained to me. But, Intel does not give you space to think of new things. The best new idea I came up with since joining Intel was the use of redundant arithmetic to index the cache. I've also got a great big chip on my shoulder, because I never did well in my undergrad, never published the stuff I worked so hard on in my MS, have never published in a classy setting, and have no real proof that I'm a smart guy. Sure, I worked on P6, and I think I contributed a lot - I probably think I contributed more than I did, there were a hell of a lot of good people working on P6 - but again, there's no proof. So I guess that a Ph.D. is a way of showing that I am smart - that there are some ideas that are incontrovertibly mine . Choose your goals, and work towards them. Maybe even your failures (I got my first good job with a resume that contained a graph pointing out the bimodal distribution of my grades). One of the tragedies of modern life is the number of people who have been turned off by the first style of education they encountered, but who would have done well with another. I mean by \"drones\" the people for whom everything seems easy, who do well in everything they do, but who do not choose what they do, but rather drift according to whatever is placed in front of them. In fact, they may well be smarter: maybe they aren't drifting, but really have intellectual goals they want to acheive, but go about things the easy way. And they contribute as much, or more, to society as we rebels do. It isn't - at least not necessarily. All I want to say is that, if you're rebellious by nature, it doesn't have to be all or nothing.",
