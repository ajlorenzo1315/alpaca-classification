    "Cuerpo": "It has a successor, though: Recollection Books Bailey-Coy Books 414 Broadway East  323.8842 Pleasant, moderate-sized shop, excellent for browsing, good fiction and poetry sections. This is a wonderful place to find the new book you didn't know you were looking for. Excellent for fiction and poetry, decent for literary criticism, rather sparse philosophy section. This bookstore's staff will know of a mystery that takes place there -- a great bon voyage present. Magus Bookstore 1408 NE 42nd  633.1800 Typical university used bookstore. Review pending Mystery Bookshop 117 Cherry 587.5737 Lots of new and used mysteries. Recollection Used Books 4519 University Way 548-1346 This is clearly a bookstore run by people who love books. A sci-fi fan wasn't impressed with their offerings in that genre, but the selection of non-English titles in the comfortable room upstairs (complete with chairs and a chess table) more than made up for that lack. Very good selection of used and collectible books at good prices. Good selection of used SF, history, military. This is about a 90-minute drive from Seattle. Fantasy and SF, new and used. Murder by the Book ( 7828 SW Capital Highway, 503-293-6507, and 3210 SW Hawthorne Blvd, 503-232-9995). Powell's has new and used books by the millions. There is a coffee shop in the store for more serious browsing. Powell's Books for Cooks (3739 SE Hawthorne, 503-235-3802). There is a children's section in a separate store next to it. Powell's Hawthorne (37-something SE Hawthorne--they're adjacent to Powell's Books for Cooks) is a new branch of the main store. U.S. Government Bookstore (1305 SW First Avenue, 503-221-6217). A walk around will find this place and many more of interest to the reader.",
