    "Cuerpo": "In this workshop, we will explore firsthand the basics of the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) used to create home pages, see how to include digitized images and find out how to load pages so that they are accessible to the entire Internet community. a. In the first part of our workshop we'll create a sample personal page on your diskette. The contents should be simple text, including: your name on the first line your class year and major on the second your campus address, phone number and e-mail address on subsequent lines a list of your classes for this term a paragraph describing your extracurricular activities and interests Note: Any word processor would be suitable for this purpose, as long as you can save files in text-only (ASCII) format. Beginning HTML tags Almost all HTML tags have the following format: <tag> text, possibly including other tags </tag> As we'll see, there are some notable exceptions, but in general you should always think of tags as coming in pairs. These are the highlighted words (and images) on a page that can take you somewhere else on the same computer, or halfway around the world with a single click. For example, if I am currently accessing a page in my own directory ( ~treu ) and want to access the Cheers page, the relative URL simply reduces to cheers.html To simplify matters, just remember this: use relative URLs when you are creating links to pages of your own, and use absolute URLs when you are creating links to pages elsewhere on the Web. Let's add a link or two to your home page. You can also make a link out of any text on your page. See if you can find a Web page dedicated to one of your activities or interests and make a key word in your \"activity paragraph\" into a link to that page. All you need to do is create a file that ends in .htm in your Web directory and create a link to it. Just store this page as band.htm in the same directory as your index.htm file. Create a link to this new page in your index.htm file and try it out. Add one of these to your page. In general, any number of tags can be applied to the same text, as long as it makes sense to do so. To change this, you will have to \"upload\", or copy, your page to a computer which does have a Web server running on it. Using images Finally, let's add an image to your page. First use Netscape to access the Furman home page ( http://www.furman.edu/ ). Remember that anything that you can view using Netscape-- anywhere in the world-- can be downloaded and use in your own pages. We can make the Furman masthead image into a link to the Furman home page simply by including the URL for the image inside the tag for a link.",
