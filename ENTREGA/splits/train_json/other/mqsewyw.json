    "Cuerpo": "You may attend either lecture (for exams you need to attend at the time for which you are registered). We have our own Macintosh computers : The laboratory is located on the first floor of the Computer Science Building in Room 1366. However, we strongly recommend lecture attendance and you are solely responsible for making sure that you do not miss assignment due dates and other class information including announcements, exam rooms and material covered on the tests. Exam attendance is mandatory : If you are ill and cannot attend an exam you must present some written dated proof of your excuse and notify Sally Peterson as early as possible PRIOR to the scheduled time of an exam. The assignments will be given to you in lab class. In the course of the semester each person will have approximately the same number of hours on the computer. If you have access to a Macintosh computer and any or all of this software (versions compatible with those that we use) you are welcome to work outside of the lab. You may also work in 1366 at a different time than your regularly scheduled lab, if there is space (students registered for that particular lab time always have priority). If you don't regularly attend lab, be sure to bring your disk when you turn in your assignment since you may be asked by your TA to demonstrate the skills learned in the assignment. There are laser printers in the lab for you to use for printing your CS132 assignments. There will be a sign-up sheet posted (at 4 pm Friday) on the door of the lab for you to reserve a machine for a particular time. Grading : 50% of your grade is the average of your lab assignments and 50% is the average of your exams (15% for each exam). Usually grades are higher for the lab assignments and lower on the exams. 92 - 100    A Save your graded quiz and exam papers and the files on your disks until you have checked the posted scores to be sure that your points are recorded correctly. Although you are encouraged to communicate with each other on design and planning and on the use of the software, you may not have someone else do part or all of the work for you. It is your responsibility to find these rooms (A list will be posted in our lab, outside my office, with the dept. It is not possible to change the time / date of a final (by L & S policy & Faculty Senate rule) even if you have more than three exams in a 24-hour period. You may be asked to show your UW picture ID at the exams; be sure to have it with you. These labs are not staffed by \"our\" TAs and will not have \"our\" data documents (which you need for the assignments).",
