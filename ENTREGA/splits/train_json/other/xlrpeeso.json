When all the sides of a polygon have the same length, the polygon is called regular . All regular polygons can be fit perfectly within a circle (such that the circle touches all the corners of the polygon). The Problem You are to write a program that will perform a few calculations on regular polygons. Your program will ask the user (1) how many sides the polygon has, and (2) what the length of each side is. As output, your program will display (1) the area of the polygon, and (2) the radius of the circumscribed circle. Just use the formulas given below; you don't need to understand them at all! The Formulas In the following equations, sides is the number of sides, edge is the length of each side, radius is the radius of the circumscribed circle, and area is the area of the polygon. Note that sides and edge are what the user enters, and radius and area are what the program outputs. Also note that edge is squared in the formula for area . Area of polygon: 61.1524 Radius of circumscribed circle: 5.529575 When that is working, create some variables and add the input commands. Use pow(x,y) for calculating the square root. Remember to use #include<math.h> , since you will need cos(), sin(), and pow(). Use meaningful variable names. For instance, see the sample run given above for a square. Here's another case: when the number of sides is 3 and the length of each side is 2.1, the area is 1.909586 and the radius is 1.2124356. This is to be done just like in program 0.
