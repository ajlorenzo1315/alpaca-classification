Mooney Proceedings of the Twelfth National Conference on AI , pp. (AAAI-94) A new inductive learning system, LAB (Learning for ABduction), is presented which acquires abductive rules from a set of training examples. LAB has been experimentally evaluated and compared to other learning systems and an expert knowledge base in the domain of diagnosing brain damage due to stroke. A new system for learning by induction, called LAB, is presented. LAB (Learning for ABduction) learns abductive rules based on a set of training examples. It is compared to other learning systems and a knowledge base produced by an expert. The results are promising: the rule base learned is simpler than the expert knowledge base and rules learned by one of the other systems, and the accuracy of the learned rule base in predicting which areas are damaged is better than all the other systems as well as the expert knowledge base. We present an algorithm that combines these techniques and a system called BRACE that is a preliminary implementation of this algorithm. A First-Order Horn-Clause Abductive System and Its Use in Plan Recognition and Diagnosis Hwee Tou Ng and Raymond J. Mooney Submitted for journal publication. In this paper, we view explanation as abduction , where an abductive explanation is a consistent set of assumptions which, together with background knowledge, logically entails a set of observations. We have applied our abductive system to two general tasks: plan recognition in text understanding, and diagnosis of medical diseases, logic circuits, and dynamic systems. While it has been realized for quite some time within AI that abduction is a general model of explanation for a variety of tasks, there have been no empirical investigations into the practical feasibility of a general, logic-based abductive approach to explanation. In this paper we present extensive empirical results on applying a general abductive system, ACCEL, to moderately complex problems in plan recognition and diagnosis. The results indicate that general purpose abduction is an effective and efficient mechanism for solving problems in plan recognition and diagnosis. If the user provides complete information on the input behaviors and the dimensions of the input variables, the resulting model is unique, maximally constrainted, and guaranteed to reproduce the input behaviors. An Efficient First-Order Horn-Clause Abduction System Based on the ATMS Hwee Tou Ng and Raymond J. Mooney Proceedings of the Ninth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence , pages 494-499, Anaheim, CA, July 1991. This paper presents an algorithm for first-order Horn-clause abduction that uses an ATMS to avoid redundant computation. Since computing all minimal abductive explanations is intractable, we also present a heuristic version of the algorithm that uses beam search to compute a subset of the simplest explanations. We present empirical results on a broad range of abduction problems from text understanding, plan recognition, and device diagnosis which demonstrate that our algorithm is at least an order of magnitude faster than an alternative abduction algorithm that does not use an ATMS.
