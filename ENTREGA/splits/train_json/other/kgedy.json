C                 Main program REAL ..., AREAC Function Header The function header specifies the name of the function, the type of value it returns, and the name and number of input arguments. INTEGER FUNCTION FOO ( ) Only the argument names are listed in the function header. Argument Declarations The type of the arguments is specified immediately after the function header but before any local variables. Actual Arguments The value of the dummy arguments are initialized to the corresponding values in the function call, called the actual arguments . 3 * Y + 3            RADIUS = 33 Number and type of actual arguments must correspond to number and type of dummy arguments. Local Variables As with the main program, user-defined functions may need to store intermediate results in variables. Important : Variables declared in another function or in the main program cannot be used within a function! FACT = N Function Result The purpose of a function is to compute and return a result . The result of a function is the last value assigned to the function name using a normal assignment statement. SUBROUTINE GRAPH (MIN, MAX, POWER) C     Print a graph of Y = X^POWER from X=MIN to X=MAX Subroutines also take one or more input values (i.e. arguments) but may or may not return any results. +----------+ User-Defined Subroutines Subroutines resemble functions. A result is returned to the main program when the arguments are re-assigned inside the subroutine. As with functions, the actual arguments in the subroutine call may be literals, variables or expressions. VERY IMPORTANT : The actual arguments in the subroutine call must always be variables . END When the dummy arguments WHOLE and FRAC are re-assigned, the actual arguments IPART and FPART are re-assigned too. Input/Output Arguments Some arguments can pass values both into and out of the subroutine. Called input/output arguments . C     Input/Output Arguments",
