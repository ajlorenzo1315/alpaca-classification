RESEARCH EXPERIENCE Distributed and Parallel Systems Using Runtime Measurements in Parallel Processor Scheduling: Used runtime measurement of application efficiency to perform dynamic processor scheduling. In the multi-programmed case, we showed how to use runtime measurements to improve system performance both interactive and batch environments. Networking User-level Protocol Implementation: Demonstrated the feasibility of implementing communication protocols (e.g., TCP/IP) as user-linkable libraries instead of in the kernel or as a part of a monolithic system server. Extended the naming server in the Spring distributed systems to support the storage of persistent objects. Software Engineering & Computer Security: Jointly developed a software development methodology targeted to an environment where there may be malicious developers attempting to corrupt the software under development (e.g., insertion of trojan horses). Led the development of a prototype tool providing automated support for assessing the adherence of a software development approach to our methodology. System Engineering: Jointly developed a preliminary design for a special-purpose transaction processing system. Nguyen, Vaswani, and Zajorjan.
