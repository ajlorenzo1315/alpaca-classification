Version History Following is a listing of all distribution releases of the UV system with a short description of changes made at each release: Revision 1.20 (29-June-1995) Minor revision, fixed a few bugs in the parser related to type checking and constant folding. Revision 1.17 (12-January-1995) Added a missing initialization of the memory statistics routines that could lead to erroneous statistics in the memory dialog, and fixed a bug with the strongest invariant computation that could cause problems in the presence of declared specification variables that were not modified in the program they were declared in. The documantation remains unchanged. Markus Kaltenbach (markus@cs.utexas.edu)",
