    "Cuerpo": "Its from last year but i am still living with vin and dan and some newcomers(kchee, jgomez1,& cjackso1). This is Dan. He's my roommate. He was my roommate last year too. He is pretty neat. This is picture of Dan and Me. We went to a dance and got pictures taken with our dates and then with eachother. That was fun! This is Dan and Vince. He is on the fencing team and he hits us with his sword sometimes. Vince was sort of seeing this girl Aimee. She is neat. I thought they were kissing buddies but they wouldn't say. I think they are neat together. This was my other roommate Bruce. He is from Seattle. Oh, and Vince is from Maine and Dan is from Kansas, by the way. Anyways, the hat he is wearing is actually Vince's from high school. Bruce used to be in the band though. Heads from left to right are: Diane, Kathy, Smu(me), Bruce, Vince, Aimee, Amy, Dan.",
