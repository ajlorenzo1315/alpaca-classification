    "Cuerpo": "This page is from 1995! Many of the projects can be adapted from 3 to 6 credits depending on how much work you can put in. You need to sign up 'til sept. 30th if you want to get project credits this semester. If you find that most of the interesting projects require knowledge you don't have, look into extending a course project into the M-Eng project. Note: No knowledge of linguistics is required. We have a language acquisition system that uses symbolic machine learning techniques to perform a number of disambiguation tasks on natural language texts at the word level (e.g., decide the appropriate meaning or part of speech of a word in a given context). Note: No knowledge of linguistics is required. Nikos Chrisochoides A number of projects on Problem Solving Environments Robert Constable Any project I offer will be part of CS572 and will assume knowledge of Nuprl taught in that course. Hybrid System Simulation:  Write a simulator for hybrid systems, which are distributed real-time systems that consist of interacting digital and analog components. You have to know X-window programming. Scientific Visualization:  Use computer graphics and animation tools to visualize the output of the hybrid system simulator. You have to know X-window programming, some computer graphics, and an animation tool. Prerequisites for this project are knowledge of C++, matlab, and a numerical analysis course (e.g. CS421). Build a system for finding and tracking people in a sequence of images. Experience with C and images required. Rich Zippel There are two basic areas in which we are active, development of very high level software development tools, especially in scientific computation, and infrastructure to support collaboration among people separated by time and space. Among the projects in this area are: Develop and code new program transformations (e.g. for parallelization, new numerical computation techniques, or transformation that instantiate a particular concurrency control mechanism). A few of these projects are listed below, but there are a wide number of different possibilities. The manuals for our tools have been written in Framemaker. Develop automatic tools and processes for going back and forth between Framemaker and Latex.",
