Our research is in several areas: constraint imperative programming, in particular the Kaleidoscope language constraint logic programming, in particular the HCLP language scheme constraint hierarchies constraint solvers using constraints in user interface construction People Faculty: Alan Borning , borning@cs.washington.edu Current Students: Kirsten Hildrum , hildrum@cs.washington.edu Gus Lopez , lopez@cs.washington.edu Andy Montgomery , montgmry@cs.washington.edu Alumni: Jeffrey Berg Scott Bradley Rob Duisberg Bjorn Freeman-Benson, bnfb@oti.com Axel Kramer John Maloney Amy Martindale Sean McAteer, smcateer@cs.washington.edu David Nagy-Farkas, davidnf@cs.washington.edu Michael Sannella, sannella@faline.bellcore.com Paul Williams Molly Ann Wilson Michael Woolf Papers The following list contains citations for recent papers.
