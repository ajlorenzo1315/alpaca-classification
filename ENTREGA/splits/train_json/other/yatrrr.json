Our Web server runs as a dynamically linked extension on top of the SPIN kernel. Our server is structured as a three-level cache - memory, fast extent based file system, and a remote NFS server. On a miss there, the files are fetched from a remote NFS server. They show information on the number of threads, the set of instantiated domains, and the state of the heap, for example. The SPIN Operating System SPIN is an extensible operating system kernel that supports the dynamic adaptation of system interfaces and implementations through direct application control, while still maintaining system integrity and inter-application isolation. These are used by collections of extensions to implement general system services such as address spaces, IPC, threads, and networking. All extension code (and most of the kernel) is written in the type safe language Modula-3. For example, with SPIN running on a 133 MHz Alpha, an application can handle and recover from a page fault in 29 microseconds. The same operations under Mach or Digital UNIX take up to 30 times longer on the same hardware. Recent reports and papers Extensibility, Safety and Performance in the SPIN Operating System A design, implementation and performance paper. Appeared in the 15th SOSP. Language Support for Extensible Operating Systems We've been pretty happy with M3, but we've had to deal with a few shortcomings in order to use the language in a safe extensible operating system. Safe Dynamic Linking in an Extensible Operating System Describes the dynamic linker we use to load code into the kernel. Language and Runtime Support for Dynamic Interposition of System Code Describes the kernel's internal communication and extension facilities. Shows use of dynamic code generation to improve the performance of a critical kernel service. More Information Paper trail : Project Reports, Talks. Project members :Who we are.
