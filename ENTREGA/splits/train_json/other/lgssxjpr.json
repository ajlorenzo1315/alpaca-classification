    "Cuerpo": "What is Emacs? For the purposes of this class, you shouldn't have to learn too much about it, and I recommend you don't spend too much time trying to figure out the intricacies of emacs (for example, today I spent 2 hours figuring out how to bind the Control-up-arrow key to a specific function in a specific emacs mode) -- if you need to know something and can't figure it out quickly, ask. You could run emacs at home on your Vic-20 in this mode, for example. This is done using xhost + followed by the name of the machine that you'll be running emacs on. For example in the above situation, from an mscc prompt, I would type: setenv DISPLAY spirit.cs:0.0 Now when you run emacs, it should show up in its own window on your display, and you should be able to use the mouse and such. There can also be buffers for other purposes -- for example the minibuffer is used for emacs-user interactions; you can have a buffer in which you're running a Minischeme or Lisp interpreter; etc. For example, if you edit a file with the .ml extension, emacs will realize that this is an ML file, and will put you in SML mode, which knows how ML programs should be indented. Similarly, if you open a .c file, or a .cl file, its buffer will be in C-mode or Common Lisp mode, respectively, and know the syntax of that language. Cancelling and Exiting The two most important key sequences to know in Lisp are C-g and C-x C-c . Lisp will prompt you if you haven't saved all of your buffers, or if you've left any processes (like a Lisp or ML interpreter) running. The control-key sequences are so engrained in my mind (and so much easier, since you don't have to go to the mouse all the time) that I usually forget the menus are there. Lots of the things that I'm about to explain to you are bound to be in the menus as well, but I don't know for sure. If you're not sure of the filename, you can hit SPACE at any time to get a list of files which match what you've typed up to that point. To save a file, use C-x C-s . If there have been any changes, the file will be written to disk. (read on...) Cutting, Copying, and Pasting One way to cut text in emacs is to use C-k (kill). C-k takes out the text between the cursor and the end of the line. Move between the buffers using C-x C-o or the mouse. When editing Lisp or ML, we recommend dividing your window in this way so that you can edit in one and run the interpreter in the second. To switch to a different buffer, use C-x b and emacs will prompt you for its name.",
