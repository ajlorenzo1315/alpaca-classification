The answer is yes, and many students have done so, but quite honestly, it is not completely easy. We have tried to organize the course so we will not stand in the way of this, but you will be largely on your own in leaping a number of hurdles. You can also find these \"Dial IP\" files, for both PCs and Macintoshes, in the Sieg 324 lab. If you have Windows 95 at home, you don't need the dial IP software - Win95 has networking software built-in. For a quick start, look at C&C's Win95 information, as well as the more general information as mentioned above. MSVC is available at the University Bookstore for about $55.00 plus tax. The Borland C++ compiler is another popular tool for PCs, but it will not be supported by course staff to the extent that MSVC will be. It is available at the University Book Store with a student price of about $90. If you are planning to continue in CSE 143, you will also want a C++ compiler. \"Symantec C++ for Macintosh\" (no, it is not called Think C++) includes Think C, as well as C++ and associated tools. These are the products we have installed in the Sieg 324 lab and are probably a safe bet for home use. For the later graphics assignments you will find it will be impossible to use DOS-based products and difficult or impossible to use older versions of the Borland and Microsoft compilers (Borland prior to version 4.0 and Microsoft prior to version 1.52). You might also be able to use C compilers on the campus Unix machines, but we think the lack of suitable graphical user interfaces and debuggers will be a huge obstacle. If you do not want to buy a compiler, you can write and edit your programs on almost any computer with a simple text editor or word processor (saving your file as \"plain text\"). This may let you do the bulk of your typing at home, then bring the file to the lab for testing. In general tabs are to be avoided because of the different ways in which they are displayed in different contexts, in particular what you see may be different from what is displayed when you print the output you have turned in. Outgoing file transfer options are about the same as above: bring a disk to the lab, or use Netscape, or a comparable browser. To turn in files, you can bring a disk to the lab or use Netscape. Mac file transfer: See Downloading Macintosh Binaries for more information about downloading Macintosh files without visiting the lab.",
