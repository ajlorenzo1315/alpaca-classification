    "Cuerpo": "The * specifies to use the default output format to print the items on the line. PRINT 15, NAME 15   FORMAT(1X, A8) prints Christop Use A with no width specified to print the string in the same number of columns as its declared length. PRINT 15, NAME 15   FORMAT(1X, A)\t(same as A11) Insert Spaces - nX Spaces/blanks can be inserted between any two items in the PRINT statement. Formatted Input Unformatted input: All the data on the line has to be read into variables. Use a FORMAT statement with edit descriptors to specify the type and width of each value to read in. REAL - Fw.d Read only the next w digits as an REAL value, where the last d digits are to the right of the decimal point. ^^^^^^ If the user does enter a decimal point then it over-rides the value of d . 15   FORMAT(A7) User enters Kilroy1994junior\t(NAME='Kilroy1###') ^^^^^^^ If w is not specified then read in the same number of characters as the declared length of the variable. READ 15, NAME 15   FORMAT(A) User enters Kilroy1994junior\t(NAME='Kilroy1994') ^^^^^^^^^^ Note: The string is not enclosed by apostrophes! OPEN Statement Before you can read or write to a file it must be opened . The OPEN statement specifies the name of the file, assigns it a unit nummber and specifies whether the file will be read from or written to. Reading From Files Use a modified READ statement to read from a file rather than the keyboard. READ (1, *) X, Y, Z Must OPEN the file before you can read from it. READ (1, 15) X, Y, Z 15   FORMAT (3F6.2) If the line contains more data than is read in then the rest of the line is ignored. e.g. 131.92-21.67 ^^^^^^^^^^^^ 18.412345 ^^^^^^--- Writing To Files Use the WRITE statement to write to a file rather than the screen. WRITE (2, *) 'The answer is', 42 Must OPEN the file before you write to it. End-of-File (writing) When you have finished writing everything to an output file, write a special end-of-file marker at the end. END FILE (UNIT=3) Must be the last thing written to the file. READ (1, *) NUM1 Exits the loop when the READ statement is re-executed and there's no more data to read; i.e. not immediately after the last number is read.",
