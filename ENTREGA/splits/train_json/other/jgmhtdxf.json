Kai Zhu, D.F. Wong and Y.W. Chang. Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design , Nov. 1993. We study the properties of switch modules and present an algorithm for switch module design. Contact: yaowen@cs.utexas.edu Shashidhar Thakur and D.F. Wong. Proceedings of the International Symposium on Field Programmable Gate Arrays, February 1995. In this paper, we give a method to design FPGA logic modules, based on an extension of classical work on designing Universal Logic Modules (ULM). Specifically, we give a technique to design a class of logic modules that specialize to a large number of functions under complementations and permutations of inputs, bridging of inputs and assignment of 0/1 to inputs. Our functions can specialize to up to 23 times the number of functions that Actel functions can. Contact: thakur@cs.utexas.edu Shashidhar Thakur and D.F. Wong. The need for a two-way interaction between logic synthesis and FPGA logic module design has been stressed recently. Having a logic module that can implement many functions is a good idea only if one can also give a synthesis strategy that makes efficient use of this functionality. We follow a dual approach, by focusing on a specific technology mapping algorithm, namely the structural tree-based mapping algorithm, and designing a logic module that can be mapped efficiently by this algorithm. It is known that the tree-based mapping algorithm makes optimal use of a library of functions, each of which can be represented by a tree of AND, OR and NOT gates (series-parallel or SP functions). Mapping results show that, on the average, the number blocks of this function needed to map benchmark circuits is 12% less than that for Actel's ACT1 logic modules. Contact: thakur@cs.utexas.edu",
