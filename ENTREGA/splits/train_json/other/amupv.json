    "Cuerpo": "I have provided a sample program that plays the game tic-tac-toe for your use and experimentation. While working on this exercise, you will be reading pages that indicate UNIX commands to enter. These commands are preceded by a % , which it represents the UNIX prompt. If you are unfamiliar with how to do this see the page on how to create a directory . This sample program can be obtained from the samples page that is linked to the CS367 home page. Further instructions are provided in the samples page for getting a copy of sample code files such as for this case tictactoe.cc. Now that you have a copy of the source file for the tic-tac-toe game you should look at it with and editor. See edit your program for more information on how to edit your program. You do not need to make any changes to compile the program, which will be the next step. This new xterm window will be used for compiling your program. % g++ -Wall -g -o tictactoe tictactoe.cc For more information about the compiler flags see the page on compiler flags . In this case you would need to go to your editor window and make corrections to your source code. For this program you should not experience any compiler errors, unless you accidentally changed the source with the editor. In that case you can simply get a new copy of this sample code. The next step after your program compiles would be to run your program. This is doen by entering the following at the UNIX shell prompt: % tictactoe More information about running programs is located here . While developing programs it is prefered to run your program in a debugging environment. % gdb tictactoe This start the debugger and allows you to control the execution of your program with breakpoints and by stepping through the program's instructions, and to examine the contents of variables and other memory locations. The are many other commands and some of the most useful are described here . More information about the program development cycle can be obtained from the Working with C++ in UNIX page.",
