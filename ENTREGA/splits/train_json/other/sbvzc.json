You will write the transform Tview*Tpers and apply it to a few simple objects. The resulting program will allow you to view the objects in world, view, and screen coordinates. To do this, click on each of the filenames shown below. Name each file with the same name as shown below. CameraTemplate.net CameraTemplate.cfg Part 1: CameraTemplate.net constructs a simple object made of two cubes and a few spheres (see Images ). Fill in the formulas in the compute modules to simulate the Tview and Tpers matrices given in class and in Watt pages 64 and 73. Note that DX used a right-handed display system, so you will have to negate the x view coordinate. Note that the images (with the exeception of the world image) are incorrect until you fill in the compute modules! Part 3: Convert the viewing frustrum given in the program from view coordinates back to world coordinates (using an inverse camera transform) and collect it with the original objects so that the viewpoint and viewing frustrum are visible in the world coordinate Image window. There are three Image modules and one Display module so that you can see the world, view, and screen coordinate systems, plus the final view of the object. The following images are an example of what the program should produce. World Coordinates View Coordinates Screen Coordinates Screen Projection Questions/Writeup: Write out the formula from each compute module used for each transformation. Be prepared to demo your synthetic camera, exercising all interactors given in the template. The program should include the viewing frustrum in world coordinates. The program should also include the modification for a variable window width. As usual, style counts. Back to Main Page Go to Lab 6 Last modified, 1/24/95, B. Land. Copyright Statement",
