    "Cuerpo": "It is supposed to take over the world and be the definitive answer to object technology...according to Microsoft of course. OLE is an \"open\" standard...depending on who you ask. If you ask Microsoft, it is open, but if you ask anyone else, they will probably disagree. OpenDoc Overview OpenDoc is backed by many companies in the computer industry. The standard is controlled by an organization called C.I. OpenDoc is positioned as a component architecture that exceeds the capabilities of Microsoft's OLE. OpenDoc Supporters These are the companies that have officially jumped on the OpenDoc bandwagon. Each of the companies and organizations have pledged to use it, contributed time, money, and/or helped to implement it. Apple IBM Corp. C.I. Labs Novell/WordPerfect Taligent, Inc. Adobe Borland Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) Overview The Foundation classes are a \"thin\" wrapper around the Windows (16-bit & 32-bit) API. These classes also have utility classes that implement some base functionality that could prove to be useful during a project. In addition to the other features, the \"best\" part of MFC is the cross platform aspect of the libraries. If the libraries are used for application development, almost all that is required for a Mac OS compliant version is a simple recompile of the code. Foundation Class Supporters Microsoft The gatekeeper of the libraries. It also ships with their Visual C++ product. Symantec Symantec has licensed the classes from Microsoft to ship them with their compiler product. Borland Borland has added compiler support for the class libraries (to support the non-standard extensions Microsoft used). Their compiler does not ship with the libraries included. Borland ships their own class libraries (Object Windows Libraries) with their compiler. Last updated: 12 September 1995 jmm@cs.cornell.edu",
