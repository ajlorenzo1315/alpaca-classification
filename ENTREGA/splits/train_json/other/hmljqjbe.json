Declaring Array Variables Specify the name of the array, the base type , and the number of values to store - called the size of the array. REAL SCORES(MAXSIZ) SCORES array variable stores three INTEGER 's under a single variable name. Referencing Arrays To access a particular value in an array you specify the array name and the subscript of the value (i.e. its position in the array). arrayname(subscript) The first value in an array has subscript 1, the last has subscript arraysize . PRINT *, 'Your score is ', SCORES(1) READ(1, 100, END=150) SCORES(3) Store values in an array using the assignment statement , just like simple variables arrayname(subscript) = value INTEGER N, SCORES(3) SCORES(N) = SCORES(N*4-5)-SCORES(1) Value of array subscript must be in the range 1 ... arraysize . Right : SCORES(N), SCORES(N*4-5) Wrong : SCORES(-13), SCORES(5), SCORES[2], SCORES(2.3) Important : The type of the array variable, the base type, and the subscript are very different. N               INTEGER Arrays and DO Loops Arrays are commonly processed using a DO loop. C     Print out all the scores The DO loop counter COUNT is used as the array subscript to sequentially access the values one at a time. READ *, (SCORES(I), I=50, 100) Equivalent to a DO loop inside the READ statement, so everything is read off the same line. Can print in any part of an array on the same line using an implied DO loop . PRINT *, (SCORES(I), I=50, 100) Array Arguments Arrays can be passed into and out of user-defined functions and subroutines as array arguments . As with passing simple variables as arguments, array variables must first be declared in the main program. C     Finds the highest value in the list C     Declare arguments Whole arrays can be passed in as input arguments PRINT *, GETMAX(SCORES, MAXSIZ) or individual values can be passed as input arguments, just like simple variables.",
