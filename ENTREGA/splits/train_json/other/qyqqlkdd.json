These control problems require systems which can be proven to meet the hard deadlines which the environment imposes. Most research on ``real-time AI'' (RTAI) focuses either on restricted AI techniques that have predictable performance characteristics or on reactive systems that retain little of the power of traditional AI. To combine unrestricted AI techniques with the ability to make hard performance guarantees, we are investigating a Cooperative Intelligent Real-Time Control Architecture (CIRCA). In this architecture, an AI subsystem reasons about task-level problems that require its powerful but unpredictable reasoning methods, while a separate real-time subsystem uses its predictable performance characteristics to deal with control-level problems that require guaranteed response times. By manipulating the responses that the real-time subsystem is guaranteeing, the AI subsystem attempts to ensure that the real-time subsystem will meet hard deadlines and also achieve the overall system goals. In constructing control plans, CIRCA determines what actions it must guarantee to take and how often it will be able to take them to ensure that the system does not enter a state where it could transition into failure (due to the passage of time). Currently, CIRCA is able to develop such control plans when possible, and when not possible CIRCA provides well-defined transformations to the graph model (based predominantly on eliminating or extending various types of transitions) that allow it to systematically relax requirements until it can guarantee the performance of a control plan. We are also investigating improved scheduling techniques for efficiently generating guaranteed control plans, using internal state in the real-time subsystem to reduce costly sensory actions, and strategies for transitioning among control plans.",
