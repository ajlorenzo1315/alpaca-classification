All opinions expressed in this page are my own (and they aren't really my opinions, just my brand of humor) and not those of the University of Wisconsin, or anyone else for that matter. The material presented here is meant to amuse, not to be offensive. Also, note that although I'm picking on these songs, I really like all of them and the artists who, uh, ripped me off. So don't get all defensive if I'm picking on your favorite artist or song. Please send positive feedback to jerel@cs.wisc.edu CD Information \"They Stole These From Me\" is a greatest hits compilation. These are all originals,  I swear. They stole them from me. They stole them from me. They stole them from me. They stole them from me. Enough covering my ass. Let's get to it. The sound clips are HUGE files. Also, I will make some of them available as WAV files. (Please see Disclaimer above). To all the artists who ripped off my songs:  I'm sorry, but your versions suck compared to my awesome originals. I apologize for the sorta poor sound quality (at least on my little sparc 10 speaker it sounds sorta crappy). I apologize for my lack of skill on the guitar. All these recordings where made/mixed on a Yamaha something or other 4 track at Jerel's home studio, which is why they are such high quality and you can hear the freeway in the background. Lot's More Good Crap Coming SOON!!!",
