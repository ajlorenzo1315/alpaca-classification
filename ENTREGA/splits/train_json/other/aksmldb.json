    "Cuerpo": "What are you going to do about it? Of course, there was no slip. Speak from notes, don't read a prepared text. Use handouts. Handouts give your audience an opportunity to be engaged by your material, rather than being passive. When their attention drifts, they can read ahead in your handouts, and find the part that interests them. [I noticed that the affiliates when bored would leave through whatever material they had in hand -- the program for the next session, for example. If they had a preview of what you were going to say next, they might be more motivated to pay attention.] Your audience can think a lot faster than you can talk, so you should give them material to think about. Handouts can provide depth of material omitted from your talk that will interest the specialists in the audience. This lends a sense of having faith in your topic and your work. Don't explain how nervous you are and what the probability is that you'll throw up midway through the presentation. Use humor that is on point. Don't unnecessarily offend part of your audience with humor that is irrelevant to your topic. Avoid using masculine pronouns to refer to a universal alternate examples with \"he\" and \"she\", or use \"they\". In addition to developing notes for your content, develop \"metanotes\" to remind you to make eye contact, or not to mumble, or not to play pocket pool, or to drink your water, etc. Don't be trapped by the conventional forms of the presentation. Dealing with questions: People's opinion of your work may well depend more on the way you answer questions than on the content or quality of your presentation. if you anticipate aggressive interruptions, establish ground rules: say that it'll take n minutes for you to present the basic material, and then there will be plenty of time for discussion. Be patient: after you finish speaking, you'll probably get a question before you can count to 10.",
