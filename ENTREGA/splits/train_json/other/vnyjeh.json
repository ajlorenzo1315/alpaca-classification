And worse than that, I've become very picky about what sounds good. My favorite artists are The Eagles Steely Dan The Beatles Eric Clapton Robert Cray Bonnie Raitt Peter Gabriel Billy Joel Growing on me Lyle Lovett Sheryl Crow Alanis Morissette I'm also interested in the music-making possibilities created with synthesizers and sequencers. Maybe things are better now. It doesn't fit in with the rest of my snobby equipment, but I like it. My favorite tv shows are Mad About You Friends Twin Peaks Wiseguy Books I never really liked reading. I also enjoy a couple of newspaper columnists' collections. I guess I just don't hang out with other people who like these things. One of my favorite games is Diplomacy which is probably the best cooperation/backstabbing game around; certainly the best for seven players. I've also been trying to get into Go. It may be the most elegant game ever invented. There are several things which I really like doing but just don't get around to doing very often for one reason or another. I've got a bunch of books about it, but I don't practice nearly enough to show anybody. I find card magic to be the most pure, but I do a little bit with coins, ropes, silks, and rings as well. If you're interested in magic, you should check out this guide . Flying I learned to fly a long time ago, but never really got into it. The actual flying was always a blast, but the preparation and overhead seemed to be a pain in the butt. I guess the ideal thing would be to be able to show up at the airport with the plane all checked out and ready to go. Sailing Sailing is another one of those things that was fun when I learned it but that I never got around to doing on a regular basis. It's probably the same as the flying problem above for me.",
