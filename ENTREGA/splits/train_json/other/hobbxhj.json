However, one should note that this is not the case when n >= 2. I believe you are right, that if T(n) = 0 for any value of n (say, n=3), then there is no function g(n) in O(1) such that 0 = T(3) = 3 ^ {g(3)}. For this problem, then, it's o.k. However, one should note that this is not the case when n >= 2. ------- End of Forwarded Message To: Yih-Chun Hu <yihchun@u.washington.edu> cc: cse421@cs.washington.edu Subject: Re: HW1, problem 3 Date: Tue, 09 Jan 1996 16:16:01 PST From: Martin Tompa <tompa@geoduck.cs.washington.edu> You're right again: I was thinking of T(n) as mapping integers to integers, which isn't necessarily the case. > > For this problem, then, it's o.k.

This would be a good time to read it if you haven't already. If you see something like this, you can ask us about it, or, you can state that you are limiting your domain to positive N, or integer N, or something like that. Date: 24 Jan 1996 15:06 PST From: Larry Ruzzo <ruzzo@quinault.cs.washington.edu> To: cse421@cs Subject: expected time for insertion sort Andy poins out that as part of the answer to  8.4-4 on page 167, you seemingly have to prove something about the expected case running time for insertion sort. That's correct, but it turns out that a simple upper bound on the worst-case running time is all you need, so this isn't too hard. Is this how I should see this problem? Thanks To: cse421@geoduck Subject: HW5, problem 3a Date: Mon, 12 Feb 1996 08:52:02 PST From: Martin Tompa <tompa@geoduck.cs.washington.edu> Yes, you should assume k is an integer.

Thanks, Michael (claym@wolf.cs.washington.edu) To: cse421@geoduck Subject: \"describe an algorithm\" Date: Mon, 26 Feb 1996 10:24:10 PST From: Martin Tompa <tompa@geoduck.cs.washington.edu> Ideally this should be done in the style of the textbook: a precise algorithm described in pseudocode (see e.g. Matrix-Chain-Order or LCS-Length), plus a short English description of how the algorithm works in general and any tricky portions of it in particular.
