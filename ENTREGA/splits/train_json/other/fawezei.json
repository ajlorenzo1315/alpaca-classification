By doing that we find that I need 2 more )'s at the end of SEPARATE function. 2) Now run (separate '(a ((1) b) (() 2))) and get: Error: The function SYMBOL is undefined. Now if we enter break command :h , we will get a list of all break commands. So we look for SYMBOL in the COND statement inside SEPARATE function and find that we should use SYMBOLP instead of SYMBOL to do the type checking. >> Use :m and :b break commands again: >>:m (SYMBOLP ANITOM) is invalid as a function. The problem is that GCL tries to interpret the result returned from (symbolp anitom) as a function. >>:b Backtrace: system:top-level > eval > separate > cond > append > separate > cond > merge > separate > cond > merge > let > DOLIST The problem happens after several recursive calls of SEPARATE and in the DOLIST statement in the MERGE function. Originally, we intend that (SYMBOLP ANITOM) is a case of the COND statement, but now it seems that COND finishes correctly and the program returns from COND and breaks in the DOLIST. We check all )'s in the COND statement and find there is a extra ) for the case before (SYMBOLP ANITOM). We fix that by deleting that ) and adding another ) at the end of (SYMBOLP ANITOM) case to include it in the COND statement. (defun merge (list1 list2) (let (result list2) (dolist (anitom list1 result) (cond ((numberp anitom) (setq result (cons anitom result))) ;;; ******> ERROR3 corrected ((symbolp anitom) (setq result (append result (list anitom)))))))) ;;; ******> ERROR3 corrected 4) Now we run  (separate '(a ((1) b) (() 2))) and get: (1 A) Although we do not get break error message, this result is not as we expect. Now we can use TRACE to trace MERGE and SEPARATE to see if they are working correctly. >(separate '(a ((1) b) (() 2))) (separate '(a ((1) b) (() 2))) 1> (MERGE (1) (B))      ====> call with (1) and (B) <1 (MERGE (1))        ====> should return (1 B) not just (1). (1 A) So we find that merge is not working as expected. >(untrace merge) >(step (merge '(1) '(b))) Type ? = (1) = (1) = (1) = (1) (1) Through the steps, we find that the problem is that we tried to initialize RESULT by LIST2. But it turns out they are both NIL. We fix that and run (merge '(1) '(B)) and (separate '(a ((1) b) (() 2))) again. So you have to exclude this specific case from your result by adding one more case in the COND statement in the SEPARATE function.",
