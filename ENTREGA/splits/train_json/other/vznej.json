    "Cuerpo": "The problem of path planning for an automaton moving in a two-dimensional scene filled with unknown obstacles is considered. The automaton is presented as a point; obstacles can be of an arbitrary shape, with continuous boundaries and of finite size; no restriction on the size of the scene is imposed. This paper presents a survey of one approach to planning collision-free paths for an automaton operating in an environment with obstacles. The approach produces provable (non-heuristic) path planning algorithms for an automaton operating in a highly unstructured environment where no knowledge about the obstacles is available beforehand and no constraints on the geometry of the obstacles are imposed. This work is concerned with planning collision-free paths for a robot arm moving in an environment filled with unknown obstacles, where any point of the robot body is subject to collision. Lumelsky, K.  Sun, \"A Unified Methodology for Motion Planning with Uncertainty for 2D and 3D Two-Link Robot Arm Manipulators\", Intern. The approach of dynamic path planning is based on the latter model and produces nonheuristic (provable) algorithms for simple robot arm manipulators operating in an environment with unknown obstacles of arbitrary shapes. The approach is independent of the specifics of the kinematic configuration, and imposes no constraints on the shape of the arm links or obstacles in the environment. A model of mobile robot navigation is considered whereby the robot is a point automaton operating in an environment with unknown obstacles of arbitrary shapes. The robot's input information includes its own and the target point coordinates, as well as local sensing information such as from stereo vision or a range finder. Harinarayan, V. Lumelsky, ``Sensor-Based Motion Planning for Multiple Robots in an Uncertain Environment'', Proc. Given the assumptions of incomplete information and decentralized planning, no provable strategy can be designed (a simple example with a dead-lock is discussed); this naturally points to heuristic strategies.

Journal of Robotics and Autonomous Systems. The task is to move the robot's tip point (its head ) from its starting position to a specified target position, collision-free for the whole robot's body. Journal of Robotics and Autonomous Systems . This work addresses the issues of hardware implementation of a sensor-based motion planning system for a whole-sensitive robot arm manipulator operating among unknown obstacles of arbitrary shape. In order to realize on-line planning algorithms while protecting the whole arm body from potential collisions with obstacles, the system includes infrared based proximity sensitive skin covering the arm body, computer hardware for signal processing and motion planning, and an interface between the planning and arm control systems. The problem of robot motion planning in an environment with obstacles can often be reduced to the study of connectivity of the robot's free configuration space. The use of space topology results in powerful, from the robotics standpoint, provable algorithms capable of on-line motion planning in an environment with unknown obstacles of arbitrary shapes.",
