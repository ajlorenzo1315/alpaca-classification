    "Cuerpo": "The goal of our work is to provide tools for exploring the design space of a parallel application by a process of prototyping and successive refinement. Development of methodology for performance prediction in which computing model varies with level of refinement; development of improved computational model LogP-HMM. At the same time, to support more accurate modeling of costs such as cache and I/O, we are developing improved performance models, i.e., a new hybrid model of parallel computation, the LogP-HMM model [LMR94], which fills a gap in the hierachy of refined models by extending a network model (the LogP) with a sequential hierarchical memory model (the HMM). This system has supported work in transformation of data parallel Proteus programs to vector models. In November 1993, we participated in a community-wide prototyping experiment defined by the Hiper-D program at NSWC as part of their next-generation Aegis development effort. Using Proteus, we developed a series of prototypes to explore design approaches to a geometric classification problem. An initial design was elaborated to reflect the functional structure of the radar system and the interactions with a system operator. A prototype system for translation of Proteus programs to executable parallel code has been developed. Allen Goldberg, Peter Mills, Lars Nyland, Jan Prins, John Reif, and James Riely.
