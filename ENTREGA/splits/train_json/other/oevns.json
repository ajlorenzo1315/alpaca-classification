The many recent references offer a solid basis for anyone beginning an adventure in modeling and simulation with incomplete knowledge. Kuipers sets himself the twin goals of describing his research and writing a textbook. He succeeds brilliantly at the first goal. The book is well organized, well reasoned, well written, and well illustrated. The numerous examples and figures illustrate every aspect of the research. Andrew Frank, Int. This book may become a very important book for Geographic Systems and for geography in general, despite the fact, that it does not discuss anything geographical or spatial in its 400 pages. It must be hoped that many geographers use the methods to model geographical processes and to explore the dynamic behavior of systems in physical and human geography. Abstract After fifteen years of work, the world of qualitative reasoning according to the QSIM viewpoint is now described in a single book. This book presents, within a conceptually unified theoretical framework, a body of methods that have been developed over the past fifteen years for building and simulating qualitative models of physical systems (bathtubs, tea kettles, automobiles, the physiology of the body, chemical processing plants, control systems, electrical circuits, and the like) where knowledge of that system is incomplete. The framework is built around the QSIM algorithm for qualitative simulation, and the QSIM representation for qualitative differential equations, both of which are carefully grounded in continuous mathematics. Scientists and engineers who have had a solid introduction to AI, however, will be able to use this book for self instruction in qualitative modeling and simulation methods. Benjamin Kuipers is Bruton Centennial Professor in Computer Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin. Table of Contents .
