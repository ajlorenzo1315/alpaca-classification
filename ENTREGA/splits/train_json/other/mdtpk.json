    "Cuerpo": "A way for special software to be invoked when the a device signals on the wire. situation:  a user program is running (executing), and a device generates an interrupt request. mechanism to respond: the hardware temporarily \"suspends\" the user program, and instead runs code called an EXCEPTION HANDLER. limitations of exception handler: since it is being invoked (potentially) in the middle of a user program, the handler must take extra care not to change the state of the user program. The key to this answer is that any portion of the state that it does change, it must also restore before returning to the user program. handler --  the code of the exception handler. The mode is saved in the Status register. This is where the exception handler code is. It does the following: 1.  save some registers (on system stack). 3.  use ExcCode in combination with a JUMP TABLE to jump to the correct location within the exception handler. sll  $8, $8, 2          # case number shifted left 2 bits # (need a word offset into table, not byte) lw   $9, JumpTable($8)  # load address into $9 jr   $9                 # jump to address contained in $9 MAL->TAL synthesis of this must be something like: la  $1, label add $1, $1, $rb then use 0($1) as addressing mode in load/store  instruction. The priorities are normally set when a machine is booted (the OS is started up). difficulty 1) Exceptions with the same priority must still be handled in some order. NOTE:  This implies that there is some hardware notion of the priority for whatever is running (user program, keyboard interrupts, clock interrupt, etc.) priorities are a matter of which is most urgent, and therefore cannot wait, and how long it takes to process the interrupt. -- keyboard is urgent because we don't want to lose a second key press before the first is handled. There are many details to get right to make this possible. The exception handler must be modified so that it can be interrupted. If the priority level checking is done in hardware, then all interrupts can be re-enabled.",
