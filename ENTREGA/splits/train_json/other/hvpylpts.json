Here are a few sample comments on how hard some students found the class last spring. Rather than getting 3 intermediate credits, it should be worth 4 advanced credits.'' ``The assignments tend to take way too long and are very hard.'' ``It shouldn't take 8-10 hours to write up a program.'' It's ridiculous.'' Do I find these comments to be correct? I agree that the course should be worth more credits, but I can't change that. The comment, ``It shouldn't take 8-10 hours...'' is off base. The students in my class only had eight programs to hand in during the previous semester, but some students thought that assignments should be something that are done the night before due! Some struggling is good for the mind, but please ask me questions and I will help you! This course is easy for some, and hard for others, but in all, the course should not be a semester long hell . How much work do I think you should expect? The usual guideline in college is to expect to spend 3 hours outside of class for every hour spent in class. But keep in mind that 3 hours is an average across the entire college spectrum from bowling to quantum physics. Where does CS302 fall in that spectrum? Expect 9-10 hours of homework each week in which we don't have exams. So that could be 12-15 hours outside of class each week, i.e. 4-5 hours for every hour in class. Please be prepared and if you find yourself snowballing homework and studying, see me for immediate help outside of class!
