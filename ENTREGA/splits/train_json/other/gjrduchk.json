    "Cuerpo": "Inductive Hypothesis: Assume for all and that implies . Since |x| = n+1 , x = ay for some and . The computation must have been for some where . By the construction of M from G , this means that there must be a production in P . Thus, for all , , , implies . ( ) Next we'll show that for all and , if , then for all by induction on n : Basis: Suppose that . Since , the base case is true. Inductive Hypothesis: Assume for all and that implies . Since n+1 > 0 and G is a regular grammar of the restricted form given in class, we know that the first step of the derivation involves a production of the form where is the first character of x and . This means that , so by the induction hypothesis, . In addition, by our construction of and the fact that , C must be in , and so . Therefore, . Thus, for all , , , implies . Proof that : Proof that : If , since G is regular then for some where . If , then and where A=S . In either case we have for some : Thus, M accepts exactly . Computations that terminate with errors (those that have no successor configurations and have not processed the entire input string) are marked with : Since is a final state and , the string aaabb is in . This comes from the fact that you can get to with a string of the form or . From , we can hop to and back to with any number of times. This describes all the possible paths to , so we have which simplifies to the above regular expression.",
