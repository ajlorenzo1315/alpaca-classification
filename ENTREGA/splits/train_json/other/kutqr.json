    "Cuerpo": "Though separated by time, place, and physical laws, We kissed, uncaring, unbound, enjoying only the moment's joining the pleasures of a nanosecond... With sadness and tearful reluctance, we parted. Declaration The smile of your tender lips, brightens my leaden heart The swirl of your soft flowing locks, warms like the life-giving sun. Oh dear one, How do I love you! Prisoner No rings of iron nor ropes of hemp bind me No walls of concrete enclose me, No cuffs of steel nor pillory of wood shackle me. I cried as I thought of the answer, but no tears came. Trembling, I answered, The first love is like a poisoned blade... thrust in your heart... by the pale hand of a loved one... ...so slowly twisting I uncovered my hand from my chest, and black blood yet flowed, trickling down to stain the floor. Cursing, I spit out a mouthful of scarlet, That is the second love, I answered, Pain from a thousand cuts... twisting, churning... the gentle touch of your loved one... placed your heart... .... in a bag of broken glass... As we walked, they asked again, What is love, they asked. I cried no tears came, but blood streaked. Voices Under the pale moon, I chatted with digital shadows. I hear the Lake of Souls: \"Save me, save me...\" \"Ha, ha, ha, ha...\" \"Tell me of that...\" \"24/f/MA...\" \"IMHO, the...\" \": ) ...\" I cried and laughed with them, Yet, in the end, They are little more, than distant voices... ... as am I to them. You and I kissed farewell, in an alley with no others, letting the wind mock my weakness -- incapable of pushing you away. You and I kissed farewell, in the chaos of night, my heart waiting -- anticipating sorrow and despair. Depression and Desolation, mine -- Dark, Shadowy, Black, and Grey Until I thought of your gentle face, your hazel eyes and dark locks, your beautiful, carefree smile. Monologue, Broken Verses In the silence of the night, I am troubled. Shards of my dreams rained upon me, their sharp points and razor edges bled me, Why is it that I must ever turn -- inward, to face that abyss within. Do you not hear the laughter within the wind? In the end, if I must pay, so be it. So be it.\" I laughed, there is no joy in the sound. [2] \"Farewell Kiss\" from \"Farewell Kiss\", 1992, translated from Chinese.",
