Part 1: Logging In You must have an account on the NT workstations before you can login. You must change this to something only you know the first time you login. Please use the usual password rules when choosing your password. You will be able to do everything from Program Manager. Look in the \"Main\" folder others. The Synario tools we use will be in the \"Hardware Design Lab Tools\" folder. The File Manager allows you to poke around through the NT directory structure. You don't really have to know where everything is, but it doesn't hurt to get a feel for the lay of the land. For this lab assignment, you will do Tutorials #1 and #2. (Please read these notes on the tutorials first.) (Make sure you copy the example project (Prep2) to your own directory before starting this tutorial.) Your first project will not be this complicated, so don't worry if it doesn't all make sense. Tutorial #2 leads you through all the steps you will have to follow to complete the first assignment:  Project creation, schematic capture and simulation. Pay particular attention to how the Verilog program is used to perform the simulation - you will have to write a simple verilog program to test the circuit you design. Part 3: Design a Simple Circuit In this part you will design and simulate the following simple combinational circuit which implements a simple median filter. Design a circuit for this filter using a schematic. Turn In: Schematic of your circuit. You must demo your simulation to one of the TAs who will sign the printout. ted@cs.washington.edu",
