    "Cuerpo": "I don't remember why I went on the tour, but I remember that I was with several other freshmen with whom I lived at my fraternity - but I can't recall if we were all together at the AI Lab because we were together as new members of the frat, or whether I came to join that frat because of liking the people I met at the AI Lab. In any event, we were playing with Logo and were left pretty much alone - we had to figure it out by ourselves. So as an undergraduate I would sometimes come to the AI Lab to play (or \"hack\") with Logo, and I began to learn to program. But in my spare time at work I was allowed to use the computer language APL, and this time I found a textbook for the language so I was able to learn some of it. In my sophomore year, I took the course 6.031 (which is the ancestor of the course now known as 6.001). The next major step in learning programming was a student job at the Architecture Machine Group (which is an ancestor of the Media Laboratory). It was while using one of these tools that I suddenly understood that there is no actual meaning in the patterns of binary ones and zeros in machine, and no significant difference between the information on a disk and in the machine's memory. It was while working at this same job that I began to think not just about how to make a program do something but how to make it easy for someone else to use. I learned several important ideas from working with the Multics people. A second idea was that programs were meant to be read by people as well as machines. The Multics group had developed a programming process which required that all modification to the system be described and justified to a group of senior programmers before being written, and be read by some person other than the author before being installed. At that time, the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory was developing the first Lisp Machines and Bernie was friends with several of the key workers on this project. I learned Lisp from Bernie not long before he left Multics to join a new startup company to commercialize the Lisp Machine. At LCSI we worked very, very hard, because we knew that money was in short supply. We did almost all our work in Lisp, on Lisp Machines, and I gradually became an expert with this language. Not only was I able to work on music, I was able to hire one of my friends, Tom Trobaugh, to work with me. Some people complain about it, but it's very important. Remember when you were a kid, and you asked a grown-up for the meaning of a word, and they told you to look it up in the dictionary? He has two qualities that are more rare. To actually make this work, I needed a car, and not just any car.",
