Here are some pictures of me! Here I am, asleep in my crib, just 3 days old. Jessica Rupp made me a nice blanket which I'm wrapped in right now. Gramma made me that cute hat I'm wearing. Unfortunately, Mommy and Daddy then put me in my crib, which, as you can see, totally clashes with my pretty blanket and hat. I guess fashion sense skips a generation. They've put me on their bed and dressed me in Tweety Bird. Here's a picture of Mommy and Daddy and Me together. My Great Grandma made that nice blanket for me. Here I am at my Brit-Bat . I'm the one sleeping. Auntie Lisa was nice enough to lend me her shoulder for a while. Here I am at 5 weeks. Here's one of them. This one was at 2 months. Mommy and Daddy and I went to Victoria for their 5th wedding anniversary. Here's a picture of us at the Buschart Gardens Here I am trying to get up. Mommy goes to this group where lots of mothers gather around with their babies. Here's a picture of us (the babies, not the mommies): More Pictures Here!",
