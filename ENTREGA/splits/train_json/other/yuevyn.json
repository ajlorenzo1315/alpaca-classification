    "Cuerpo": "In section (3) below I discuss these goals in more detail, and also talk about my career options as a computer architect in industry, and as a researcher in industry and academia. In section (4) I discuss my research interests: in section (4.1) at a very high level indicating the true breadth of my interests, but in section (4.2) at a very specific level that I propose for my Ph.D. research. I have great hope that it will be productive. However, since it is necessary to balance the abstract ideas of my research interests with the practical details of graduate school and my professional career, in section (2) I provide a brief autobiographical sketch, in the hope that this background may help explain why I wish to achieve some of the things I am setting out to do, and give credence to my likelihood of achieving them. Starting work at Intel in 1991, I got the chance to apply my CPU microarchitecture research, which I had actually begun while an undergraduate at McGill, and carried through the University of Illinois. Now that the P6 processor project is completed, I have decided to complete the Ph.D. research which I suspended five years ago. I hope that my Ph.D. research will be as relevant as my earlier work, and that the designs I will investigate will be practical enough to influence the design of computers in industry at the completion of my Ph.D.  I.e. But I am open to other topics as described in my interests section, section (4.1), below. (4) Research Interests In section (4.2) I describe one particular area in which I am interested in doing research. Before this, though, in section (4.1) I describe some very broad areas that are of interest to me. It can be seen that, although I have chosen a particular, very practical, area of applied and experimental research in computer architecture, my interests are more general. I want to make inexpensive computers faster, fast enough to support natural modes of interaction with users. I think that the study of computers produces insights into both intelligence and the structures of mathematical and logical systems; for the moment, my contribution is to make computers faster, but I am eventually interested in working in these other areas of knowledge. In the mid-1980s, when I started my career, it was obvious that one of the greatest obstacles to such improved user interfaces and thinking tools was lack of computational power. (4.2) Specific Research Focus The area that I propose to do research in, which has been the primary focus of my last ten years, is increasing the performance of computers to facilitate the applications, both \"thinking\" and \"user interface\", I describe above. Although I have worked for supercomputer manufacturer, in my research capacity I am not concerned with techniques that are applicable only to supercomputers. The basic problem in modern computer design is that the speed of the CPU is increasing faster than the speed of memory. Although such techniques will eventually be applied, the gap between CPU and memory performance is growing. Convergent Code Also known as \"Minimal Control Dependencies\", from Tjaden and Flynn's seminal paper in the 1970s, this is based on the observation that much of the time, in a modern processor with speculative branch execution, work after the close of the \"ENDIF\" part of an \"IF\" is independent of the path through through the \"IF\". However, since this is something that is already on the verge of being implemented in industry, and since research to date shows that its benefits are mixed (introducing extra memory traffic due to executing unneeded paths is undesirable on the memory starved processor model I have in mind), I consider that Eager Execution is ancillary to the techniques I already mention.",
