    "Cuerpo": "Stir-fried Taiwanese Rice Sticks (pronounced [-tsa -vee \\hoon ]) Rice sticks are thin noodles made with rice. I use the term rice sticks as opposed to rice noodles because not only do the packages say so, but it's more specific. Ingredients: 1 pack of thin rice sticks (makes 6 servings) 1/2 lbs of lean pork (for vegetarin dish, substitute pork with regular mushrooms or dried tofu) soy sauce corn starch 10 dried shiitake mushrooms 1-2 carrots 3-4 stalks of celery vegetable oil sesame/cotton seed oil cilantro 1 egg Note: most ingredients are optional. Add 2 tablespoons soy sauce and a few drops of sesame oil. Soak the dried shiitake mushrooms in hot water for a few hours and slice. Marinate with 1/2 tablespoon of soy sauce, 3 teaspoons of corn starch, and a few drops of sesame oil. (between 5-10 minutes) If you are using a sticky pot or wok for stir-frying, then soak the rice sticks in the hot water (note: do not boil the rice sticks!) Stir-fry the mushrooms in medium heat with 3 tablespoons of oil for 5 minutes. Mix 1 tablespoon of corn starch with 2-3 tablespoons of soy sauce, pour over the pork, and continue stir-frying for 2-3 minutes. Add the mushrooms back in and mix. Add the rice sticks and mix so that the rice sticks acquire the color of the soy sauce evenly. If you are using a non-stick pot/wok and soaked the rice sticks in hot water, then you need to start stir-frying the rice sticks as soon as they turn soft; stir-fry them for 5-10 minutes. But if you have a sticky pot/wok and soaked the rice sticks in cold water, then you don't have to cook them right way, but it takes longer (10-15 minutes) to stir-fry. BBQ Beef Skewers Ingredients Marinate: Beef tri-tip meat. Or you can use ribs. I don't really use that oil for marinating. This sauce may be a little hard to find in your local supermarkets, but should be easy to find in the International District. Mix the rest of the ingredients well with the meat and let it sit overnight in the fridge (minimum 4 hours). Grill for 3 minutes, turn over for and other 2-3 minutes, and it should be ready to eat. If a beef slice is too large then you can cut it into smaller strips.",
