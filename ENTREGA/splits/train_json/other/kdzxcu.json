    "Cuerpo": "My favorite part of the trip was the 5 days I spent winding my way through southern Utah -- well worth the detour if you ever get the chance. I took a number of pictures along the way, but, due to my own stupidity, the first roll of film containing pictures of the Badlands, Wall Drug, Mount Rushmore, and other highlights of South Dakota and Wyoming was ruined. It was snowing; fortunately, this was the only bad weather I encountered for the entire trip. After some casual pub-crawling, I crashed for the night at the palatial digs of Jeff O'Neill, aka Corny Bennet, aka Willow. Sioux Falls, South Dakota 451 There's really not much to see between Madison and Sioux Falls. And flat . After Wall Drug, I continued west through the Black Hills, with a side trip to Mount Rushmore . Longmont, Colorado 348 After an uneventful (but fast) drive through the southern corner of Wyoming, I stopped for a couple days to visit family in Longmont (about an hour north of Denver). Moab, Utah 466 After spending a relaxing weekend in Longmont, I headed south to Denver and then through the Rockies on I-70. Bryce, Utah 312 I spent the morning tromping around Arches National Park . Some other arches in the park are South Window Arch and Wall Arch . There is a stretch of I-70 here that has no exits for 100 miles. Zion, Utah 160 I spent the whole day exploring Bryce Canyon National Park . Overall, this was my favorite day of the trip. Hiking along the base of the canyon,  I could hear the wind blowing through the trees along the canyon rim, 1500 feet overhead. Later that afternoon, I hiked along the rim of the main amphitheater and visited a number of other scenic viewpoints along the canyon rim 1 2 3 4 . After sitting and watching the sunset over the canyon I reluctantly left Bryce Canyon and headed towards Zion. After taking a quick hike through the constricted depths of the narrows , I set out to climb to the top of Angels Landing , a spire of rock that towers 1500 feet over the base of the canyon. The late afternoon sun highlights the reds and oranges in the canyon wall in this picture . For the last 4000 miles, the weather had been great; the closer I got to Seattle, the harder it rained.",
