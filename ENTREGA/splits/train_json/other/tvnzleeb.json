    "Cuerpo": "It's time to contemplate the magnitude of the achievement that allows us to call ourselves the Class of 1996. *  *  * Most of us came to Waterloo because of an appreciation of, or perhaps an infatuation with mathematics. Although I adored my 64, I came to Waterloo for the mathematics. For me, math has always been like a toy that's constantly new. After a short while at Waterloo, immersed in mathematics like never before, I came to a startling realization. Math was magic. And this magic could not be harnessed by the likes of me. I knew that if I looked hard enough, I would see right through the magic to the ordered structure underneath. Much has happened along the way, events and experiences which shaped us and infused us with the spirit of math at Waterloo. It was only in my last term here that I finally learned how to write a zeta! Each of us relied on the guidance and support of many others to make it this far. Work terms provided a context for knowledge acquired in lectures, and helped to solidify that knowledge in preparation for coming school terms. The ones most responsible for our well being, on the other hand, were our friends and fellow students. Right from my first day at Waterloo, I have formed friendships that I can only hope will last a lifetime. And with all the incredible talent and achievement in the Class of 1996, I'm proud to call so many of you friends. They were always supportive of me throughout my time here. *  *  * Now that the journey is almost over, you may wonder what became of my mission. Underneath all the jargon, all the neat covering of tracks, all the perceived magic, there lurks the real magic, the true soul of mathematics, forever only visible in the minutest of cross sections. The single most important thing we shared is the spirit of mathematics at Waterloo. And wherever your future may lead, remember to always take that spirit with you.",
