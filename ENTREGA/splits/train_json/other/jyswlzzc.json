My office Research Work I am working on the Chinook project, which is a CAD tool for embedded systems. This is joint work with Ross Ortega and Gaetano (my advisor). The official publication is in ICCAD-92 . This was implemented and demo'ed at DAC in San Diego, CA in June 1994. This paper was submitted as a proposal but not published in the proceedings. The algorithm in DAC-94 handles fixed delay values and mode transitions. The paper submitted to DAC-95 handles delay ranges, not just worst case delays. It includes heuristics for finding short feasible schedules. code generation and timing estimation putting everything together into a program people can really use.
