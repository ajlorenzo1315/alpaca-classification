    "Cuerpo": "I rarely meddled in the cat's personal affairs and she rarely meddled in mine. Neither of us was foolish enough to attribute human emotions to our pets. -- Kinky Friedman, \"Greenwich Killing Time\" My name is Figaro, though my pet human, Jeremy, usually calls me \"the Spud\". As you can see from my picture, I am an authentic Jellicle Cat, though Jeremy refers to my coloration as \"Holstein\". I was a poor, homeless, underfed waif until I suckered Jeremy into feeding me. I admit to having a healthy appetite, but I consider my figure svelte. My favorite pastimes include: Eating Sleeping Watching pigeons Sleeping Shredding my toys Sleeping Getting stoned on catnip Sleeping Did I mention sleeping? Tragically, my new dwelling suffers from a paucity of available game, so I keep my skills honed by watching the Discovery Channel. I especially like shows with cute, fuzzy, and highly edible birds and rodents. When Jeremy is away, I sometimes spend my time between naps cruising the Net (cats do not \"surf\" - I hate getting wet). At such times, I like to visit the Internet for Cats page . I also talk to my admiring public through the newsgroup rec.pets.cats . Here is my official r.p.c. I keep hitting the right buttons, but the stupid computer never sends me any gophers. Please write to me c/o Jeremy, at jbuhler@cs.washington.edu . When you see a bump under the blankets that signfies your cat is seeking solitude, simple courtesy demands that you leave the room. Obviously, your co-dependency is so advanced that you think your cat needs you to help him manage the time he spends away from you. To you, intimacy means control, and your cat is doing everything in its power to free itself from your manipulation. You sense this, and it terrifies you to think that you might have to learn to spend some time alone, as your cat is doing. Don't you think it's time you got one as well?",
