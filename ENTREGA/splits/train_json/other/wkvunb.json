Rainier University of Washington photo Spring in the Humanities Quadrangle University of Washington photo The University of Washington Founded in 1861, the University of Washington has 34,000 students (25,000 undergraduate and 9,000 graduate/professional) and 3,500 faculty (2,900 teaching and 600 research) divided into 16 schools and colleges . The University of Washington is one of the nation's premier research universities. Steam Powered Turing Machine Computer Science & Engineering Mural Photo by Judy Watson The UW Department of Computer Science & Engineering The UW Department of Computer Science & Engineering was established as an inter-college graduate program in 1967. A second undergraduate program, in Computer Engineering , was added in 1989 when the department moved to the College of Engineering . The department currently has roughly 30 faculty members , 30 staff members , 150 graduate students , and 300 undergraduate students . The department is ranked among the top ten in the nation. Within the University, three faculty members have received the College of Engineering Faculty Achievement Award, two have received the University of Washington Distinguished Teaching Award, and one is the first member of the College of Engineering to be named the University of Washington Annual Faculty Lecturer.

We typically graduate 15 Ph.D. students and 20 Masters students each year. Our recent Ph.D. graduates have received offers from essentially every top academic department and industrial research laboratory, and dozens of our recent graduates populate these strong programs. Five recent graduates have received Presidential/NSF Young Investigator Awards, two have received Presidential Faculty Fellow Awards, and one has received a Sloan Research Fellowship. Allen Library University of Washington photo The Undergraduate Program The department has two undergraduate programs:  a Computer Science degree program graduating 80 students per year, and an ABET-accredited Computer Engineering degree program graduating 40 students per year. (The average overall freshman/sophomore GPA among students enrolling in the Computer Science program for Autumn 1996 was roughly 3.7; among students enrolling in the Computer Engineering program it was roughly 3.8. Because Washington State has the nation's fastest growing software industry -- there currently are nearly 2000 firms -- more than two-thirds of our graduates remain in-state. Winter Sunset on Mt. The region is home to many other companies critical to broad competitiveness: Boeing , The Space Needle Space Needle photo the nation's fastest growing software industry even independent of Microsoft , significant players in bioengineering and electronics, etc. There is major activity in high performance computing ( Tera Computer Company ; the Department of Energy Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ), as well as a rapidly growing biotechnology industry ( Leroy Hood's NSF Science & Technology Center , plus a number of companies that either preceded or were attracted by or created by the STC). Strong collaborations exist among these groups, and the Department of Computer Science & Engineering seeks to play a major role in the University and the region. Our annual Affiliates Meeting is a forum for interaction among more than 50 leadership companies from the region and the nation.",
