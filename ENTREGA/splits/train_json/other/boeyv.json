Here is the abstract in print, and here is an audio formatted version. The audio formatted output produced by AsTeR. The state of the audio formatter is a point in audio space. Here, audio  state was varied along a dimension in audio space before rendering sub-expressions. Section 2 superscripts and subscripts. To convey subscripts, superscripts, and other visual attributes, AsTeR varies audio state along a dimension that is orthogonal to (independent of ) the dimension used to convey sub-expressions. The following 6 examples demonstrate how superscripts and subscripts are rendered unambiguously. Section 3 Knuth's examples of fractions and exponents. These examples are taken verbatim from the TeX Book, by Donald Knuth. Notice that all of these examples comprise of the same 6 symbols, but are very different! Here are 3 examples from school algebra. Notice the context-specific rendering of these 4 expressions when speaking the base of the logarithm. Notice that the same expression can be written in more than one way. The following example is meant to illustrate AsTeR's rendering of cross-references, and is most effective when AsTeR is used interactively. AsTeR uses stereo effects to convey the two-dimensional structure of the matrix. Since the renderings produced by AsTeR utilize features of the audio space not available to a human reader (I still have not met a reader who can change the size and shape of her head as she talks:-) the rendering takes under 80 seconds.

Since this substitution process is performed by AsTeR, there is no LaTeX or Postscript equivalent for the audio output in this case. audio (14 seconds) T.V.",
