Collaboration by up to three students is permitted on this assignment. Submission Procedure . Solutions must be submitted by email to: cs514@cs.cornell.edu The solution may by formatted as ASCII (i.e. plain text) or postscript. Late Assignments will not be accepted. Problem Description Read RFC 821, The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol , and RFC 822, Standard for the Format of ARPA-Internet Text Messages . RFCs can be retrieved from rs.internic.net using anonymous ftp. Find out what a domain literal is from RFC 822. Try sending a mail message to yourself using one. Include a copy of the message you received in your homework solution. TCP is a full-duplex protocol, yet SMTP uses TCP in a half-duplex fashion. Why doesn't the client send multiple commands at once--for example, a single write that contains the HELO, MAIL, RCPT, DATA and QUIT commands (assuming the body isn't too large)? How can the DNS MX records and preference values be used to implement a load balancing scheme for incoming electronic mail? This assignment requires using ftp to connect to machines outside the CS Department firewall. There are two options for this: Use ncftp , a new interface to the ftp client. It automatically starts a connection in anonymous user mode, so that you do not have to type user names and mail addresses. It also requests that the peer machine use passive mode when transfering data, thereby allowing data to flow back over the already established TCP connection (and avoiding problems with the firewall). If the remote ftp server does not support passive mode (something indicated if you do not get any response to a \"dir\" or \"get\" request) you will have to resort to the second option. Use ftp to connect to the firewall machine (fw.cs.cornell.edu). The firewall proxy server will then setup a control connection and manage any future incoming data connections for your.",
