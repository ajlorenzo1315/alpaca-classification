IMAGELIB Listserv Date: Fri, 19 Aug 1994 14:37:20 -0700 From: Stuart Glogoff Sender: IMAGELIB Subject: About IMAGELIB In addition to existing image databases, we would like to receive information on projects that are in-development. In addition to existing image databases, we would like to receive information for the clearinghouse on projects that are in-development. To Subscribe to IMAGELIB, send the following message to listserv@arizvm1.ccit.arizona.edu The image database will reside on a World Wide Web server at the University of Pittsburgh that will be accessed through a MOSAIC client residing on the participants'computers (which can be PCs, Macintoshes, X-terminals or workstations). The image files are being stored in TIFF (Tagged Image File Format), but can be requested in GIF (8-bit color) as well as JPEG (24-bit color). Beyond agreeing to respond to the evaluation questionnaire, participants should have the following at a minimum (Note: users with PCs need only have the one platform to evaluate both the online and the CD-ROM version; users with Macintoshes or X- terminals or workstations would also need to have a PC to evaluate the CD-ROM version): Consequently, we are not too concerned about what might be an \"image database\" - we are interested in what the community thinks is one and the facilities it does or should provide. If you can help us, please respond to these questions. 3. what is your experience of image databases ? If you can include details of the newsgroup on which you found the posting we would consider that a bonus. If you are a graphics programmer who needs to know the details of a format (whether it's big- or little-endian, how many colors can be stored, and precisely what data appears in each bit or pixel) or anyone else who needs to deal with the low-level technical details of graphics files, this book is for you. In addition to describing the details of the file formats, the Encyclopedia of Graphics File Formats contains a detailed discussion of graphics concepts and programming, covering such topics as types of graphics data (vector, bitmap, metafile, scene description, animation, multimedia), truecolor, palettes, and color--its perception, conversion, and quantization. Also on the CD-ROM is a set of publicly available software--for MS-DOS, Windows, OS/2, UNIX, and Macintosh platforms--that will let you convert, view, and manipulate graphics files and images. Access our online gopher catalog via \"telnet gopher.ora.com\" (log in as \"gopher\" -- no password needed). It's a fairly good collection, maybe a third of it is of commercial quality by today's standards.
