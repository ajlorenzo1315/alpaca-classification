    "Cuerpo": "In this class, all documentation, including class information, assignments, and the syllabus, will be available ``on-line'' only. You will be responsible for reading the on-line information; I will announce when there is something new for you to read. This document is prepared to get you started so that you can access the on-line information. Fortunately, it's not so difficult, so you shouldn't have any trouble. By ``on-line'' documents I mean information that is accessible using the computers in the CS110 lab. This information is available via the World Wide Web , or WWW, which is a system for browsing on-line documents through a simple hypertext interface -- if you see a word or picture underlined or highlighted, you can click on it to get more information. Where to start First, go to the CS110 lab, which is located in room 1350 of the Computer Sciences and Statistics building (1210 W. Dayton Street). Turn left, and the CS110 lab (``the Vectra lab'') is the first room on your left. Finally, you will be prompted to choose a password. You will probably want to write down your login name (e.g., my login name is ``dsilva'') in any case. When you next login, you will use your assigned login name and your newly chosen password, not ``newuser''. You will have to view this using the Netscape browser program. In order to accomplish this follow these steps: To run Netscape (as with any other applications program), double-click on the Netscape icon in the Networking menu. You will be looking at the CS Department Home Page . You will now be on the Course Listing Home Page . Click on Sidney Hummert and that gets you to my home page. This will add my cs110 home page, to your \"hotlist\", so that it can easily be accessed from any point in your \"Internet Surfing\" by going to the \"bookmarks menu\". You have all the course information at your fingertips. It even has your first program assignment. So be sure to take a look at it while still in Netscape.",
