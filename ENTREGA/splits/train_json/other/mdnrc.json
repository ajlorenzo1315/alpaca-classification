    "Cuerpo": "-- David A. Karr This document is the home page of a World Wide Web resource located at http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/karr/lego/index.html . There is also a text-only version of this document ; that version can be expected to load faster. Hot list: The Official LEGO® World Wide Web Site -- my Guide to the LEGO FTP archive -- Joe Lauher's Construction Toy Home Page -- Michael Dorneich's Everything LEGO -- my list of LEGOmaniacs on the Web If you've been here before, you might want to check the list of what's new , updated on 24 May 1996. Contents Why this Web site? (on a separate page) Models by David Karr Models by Jane and Polly Karr Models by other people (on a separate page) Other LEGO® resources on the Web (also see the separate pages for Academic Web sites and Personal Web pages .) See my explanation on its own Web page . Look at the following pages for complete discussion and links to the images of the models: My vehicle collection . My space collection . Models by Jane and Polly Karr My daughters, Jane and Polly, have put together quite a number of models of their own, and have added important enhancements to some models I put together. Models by Other People It seems impossible to keep up with all the wonderful LEGO® models that people have posted on the World Wide Web, but take a look at my links to a few of my favorites , including an animation of a walking ``spider,'' a complete two-story house, a large red dragon, a 1959 Cadillac convertible, and several other beautifully finished models. Other LEGO® Resources on the Web To try to sort through the many available Web pages, I've very roughly categorized them as follows: High-Level Information Servers Academic Web Sites (on a separate page) Usenet News Trading Opportunities Personal Web Pages (on a separate page) Miscellaneous Good Stuff High-Level Information Servers Here are some servers that I think most people will want to see. The Official LEGO® World Wide Web Site . They have here a page with some blurbs about their product line, along with some very interesting historical information (with pictures! It includes images of models, programs for drawing LEGO®, reviews of LEGO® sets, and so forth. The archive is currently located in Austria thanks to Brian Ward. These include a very good collection of LEGO-related links on The Internet Toy Off-White Pages LEGO® Page (but again, see Michael Dorneich's list ). A number of the pages that are currently in the list of LEGOmaniacs on the Web really should be in the above list due to the depth and breadth of their content. A plain-text version (not necessarily up-to-date) is in the LEGO® FTP archive (also described above ). Jason Mantor (see his home page ) has put his enterprise, RTL Bricks , on the Web. I've tried to make as complete a list of these pages as I can.",
