Specify p calories in l color and q flavor. -work option can take many forms, operating at any hour, with a wide ranging field of interest. Examples include early morning programming sessions on the porch with portable computer, and late night doodling in unreadable mix of print and script in ubiquitous spiral bound college notebooks. -play Not a recently installed option, but significantly upgraded in System V (MEIRA) version. Option play now and forevermore includes either the concurrent process MEIRA(1) or a connected pipe to the process MEIRA. Successful execution of the ARTHUR(1) results in happiness for both ARTHUR and MEIRA. Once initiated in a given mode, there is no easy way to transfer operations to another mode. Unusual propensity to think things through. Believes logical thought process can be utilized in most instances. Quite frustrating when correct, blind to the truth when wrong. Tends to ignore input not specifically designed for current process, which yields a high level of absentmindedness. To the best of our knowledge, no other implementations exist. Sun Release 4.1.1    Last change: Just before the vows.
