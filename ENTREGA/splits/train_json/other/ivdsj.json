It was started at UC Berkeley in 1991. Its ultimate goal is to improve the lives of the poor people in India by improving facilities for basic education to illiterate children and adults. Students from many places volunteer to serve this purpose through ASHA with the firm belief that, literacy would be necessary to make people self-sufficient in improving their lives and resist exploitation. Asha has no political or religious affiliations. ASHA-Madison : Since its inception at UC Berkeley, Asha chapters have been started in some other places (details are provided in the ASHA home page at Stanford ). Tarang , a local voluntary organization at Madison, was assimilated with Asha in 1995, in order to coordinate the efforts better and channel the resources efficiently to organizations in India. Asha-Madison is a registered non-profit student organization with the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Activities: Asha-Madison contributes monetary support to various voluntary organizations in India. The money is collected through contributions from people and some fund raising events. Our activities in the last four years have included several collection drives for used clothes, selling greeting cards for \"Child Relief and You (CRY)\" and penny collection drives to meet our goals. We work with other Asha chapters, Share and Care (NJ based), Handicare International (Canada) and Volunteers in Service of Education in India (VSEI), and Child Relief and You (CRY) and have supported several literacy projects including the following: The TEA Project, Reddipalayam, Tamil Nadu Rajasthan Project, Jodhpur The Samanvaya Ashram Project, Bihar Smt Gangamma Hombe Gowda Girls High School, Bangalore, Karnataka Announcements: **NEW**-> ASHA Calendar!
