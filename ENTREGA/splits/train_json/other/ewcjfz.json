    "Cuerpo": "DRI was established in 1990 by Cornell University and Xerox Corporation and is located in the Center for Theory and Simulation in Science and Engineering on the Cornell campus in Ithaca, New York. At present, five Xerox scientists form the nucleus of DRI, collaborating in research with Cornell faculty, students, post-doctoral fellows, and visiting scientists in the College of Engineering. It is anticipated that additional companies and Cornell units will participate as the Institute grows. Collaboration technology - developing tools and methods for sharing of engineering information and creating shared engineering work spaces. DRI Partners The Design Research Institute is a partnership of industry, academia, and government. Corporations can participate in the Institute by engaging in the research of DRI, generally by establishing groups of research scientists and engineers on campus. It is anticipated that government or other external organizations will fund part of the research of DRI since the research goal of the Institute is to develop technologies that will enhance the competitiveness of all of American industry. DRI research is expected to lead ultimately to shorter product development cycles. Three themes form the heart of the DRI research agenda: information capture and access, computational prototyping, and collaboration technology. The application-specific clients of the Memory will all share a layer of intelligent access capabilities such as near-miss querying, browsing, natural language interfaces, and self-organization of the content of the Memory. These systems will be integrated into a unified environment supporting experiments with and development of enabling technologies for the Corporate Memory. Collaboration Technology The Design Research Institute recognizes that the way engineers work together as a team is as important as their individual contributions. Research in this area is just beginning, but is expected to grow to involve analysis of engineering processes and development of additional tools to facilitate collaboration. Corporate partners benefit from participation in DRI in several ways. The companies leverage both their intellectual investment and their financial investment through participation in collaborative research with university faculty and students as well as scientists from other partner companies. Government or other external funding is expected to support the Cornell affiliates. Intellectual Property Rights Most research in the Design Research Institute is intended to be open and non-proprietary. Results will be available for use by partner companies as developed and will be published in scientific journals as appropriate. In the case of a joint invention by Xerox and Cornell employees, rights shall be jointly owned. When additional corporate partners join DRI the issue of intellectual property rights will be revisited, but it is expected that agreements developed to cover the new partners will be similar to the Xerox-Cornell model.",
