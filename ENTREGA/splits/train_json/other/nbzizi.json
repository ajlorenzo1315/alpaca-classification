ViH is a vi like editor that has built-in support for the Hellenic (Greek) ELOT-928 character set. viH is build on top of vim version 1.27. Vim was developed by Bram Moolenaar mool@plex.nl. Click here for details on vim itself. viH has been developed over a short period of time and it has not been tested extensively. Please feel free to send any comments, suggestions or bug reports to: Andreas Moshovos CS Dept. Univ. (January 15, '96) Fixed umlauted map in hellenic.c. I will try to compile and add binaries for as many architectures as I can. If you have a compiled version of viH for a system that is not currently in the list I will gladly add a link to your site. Note that when you download the executables using NETSCAPE you are going to get a screen of incomprehensible text. Use the \"Save As...\" option to get a copy of the executable on your disk. Please take the time to read the README.viH file which can be found in the source code distribution. Briefly the terms are the following: You are welcome to use, share and improve the Hellenic specific part of viH. Brief description of the Hellenic features of viH. C source code in tar, gzipped form (~217K). Click Sparc Solaris 4.1.3 statically linked, ELF 32-bit, gzipped executable (~158k). Although viH can edit in Greek you'll need a Greek font to be able to look at the text! You can get some from the Hellenic resources network or from pnevmati@cs.wisc.edu There is also a local copy of the \"Obtaining and Installing Greek Fonts\" from www.hyper.gr .",
