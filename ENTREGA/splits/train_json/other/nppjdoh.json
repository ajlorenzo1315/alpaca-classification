    "Cuerpo": "This gives you more freedom in selecting an area and more burden in defining your own project. If you have a topic of your own that is not listed below, you should come and talk with me so we can work out a reasonable project description. You will write a paper that reports on your project. I will provide more details on the project report later in the semester. Projects (1) Multiprocessor Working Set: As you know from your paper assignment, the Working Set (and WSClock) algorithms are difficult to implement for shared pages. (2) Core Wars: This project is for two groups: Group A's goal is to develop a program that replicates and protects itself. There should typically be only one process running at a time on any given host. As with the other group, there should typically be only one process running at a time on any given host. (c) A contest will last 20 minutes; at the end of 20 minutes, if Group A's program is running, they win; if A's program is not running, B wins. The goal of this project would be to extend the study to include LUG. (4) More Fuzz: The goal of this project is to evaluate the robustness of various UNIX kernels, given an unpredictable calls to their basic kernel functions (system calls). The result of this study was that we were able to crash 25-33% of the standard UNIX utilities. The goal of this semester's project is to test OS kernels in a similar way to that we used to test application programs. We used the fuzz generator to attack as many UNIX utilities as possible, with the goal of trying to break them. Paradyn is unique in that it instruments an application program after the application has started running. The goal of this project is to define metrics in Paradyn to collect information from new hardware and operating systems sources. Using these new metrics (and the existing ones in Paradyn) you would then study a few parallel application programs. Your project proposal will describe your goals, methods, implementation outline, evaluation criteria, and resources needed. Next, you should provide a more detailed description of how you will approach the problem. You will provide an outline of features that you project will include, an implementation plan, and an evaluation plan.",
