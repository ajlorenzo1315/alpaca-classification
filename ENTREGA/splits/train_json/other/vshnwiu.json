It specifies the hardware and software requirements for installing and running Shore, lists the major packages distributed (including another overview of the major documents), and points to information to tell you how to retrieve the software, install it, start it running, write your own applications, and even extent the Shore server. An Overview of Shore This is a version of a paper originally presented at the SIGMOD conference on the management of data. Shore Software Installation Manual This document describes in detail how to install Shore. Shore is distributed in three forms: a documentation release , a binary release , and a source release . The Installation Manual explains how to install the documentation and the binary version of Shore, and how to build a new copy of Shore from the source release. Getting Started with Shore This tutorial shows how to write Shore application programs by describing the persistent data structures in a C++-like data-definition language called the Shore Data Language (SDL) and manipulating them with C++ programs. This document describes how to use the DirScan class. Shls can be found in the examples/shls directory of the Shore release. The Shore release includes three example programs that illustrate pool scans. Handling Errors in a Shore Application This document describes error handling facilities for Shore applications. It briefly describes the purpose of each directory and how the code in it interacts with the rest of the system. A second library, libshorecommon.a , provides many common utilities need for implementing both client and servers. One example of a VAS is the Shore server, which extends the SSM to provide typed objects with permissions and ownership and organizes storage as a tree structured name-space. This document provides an overview the SSM facilities and interface. Details of the programming interfaces are presented in a set of manual pages. Glossary of Shore Terms We have attempted to use technical terms in a consisten manner through out these documents (and in the source code). When in doubt, please consult this list. Manual Pages Shore comes with a large set of manual pages in the traditional Unix style.",
