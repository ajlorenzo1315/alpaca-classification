He said that it was fraud for Charmaine to renew her student visa since she planned to stay in the US, and that he could not allow her to return to the US on that visa. We ate at mom and dad's and then went with Corinne to the studio for our photosession. We were then the first in line at the US embassy. We ate dinner at mom and dad's, and then left with Kelvin and Alice. I wanted to take a swim, but I was told the pool was closed (it wasn't). After we were finished, we went back to mom and dad's for lunch, then we went to the Garden Hotel with Corinne. Corinne stayed with Charmaine to talk while I went to the embassy to pick up Charmaine's visa. I was back at the hotel in about 45 minutes. Charmaine and I then took a nap. After dinner, we returned to the hotel. There were three places set at our table, but he took some of the silverware from in front of me and some (not all) from the empty place. We all took a taxi back to mom and dad's to eat. When we returned, it was time for dinner. Next, we all went to pick up Favian, and then we ate lunch at a Thai restaurant. I took a few pictures of the cathedral and went back to mom and dad's. There isn't much land in Singapore, and there isn't much left of the reserve. It was very good. They weren't as bad as they could have been.",
