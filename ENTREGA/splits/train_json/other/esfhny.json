Then follow the instructions. You may also want to use a home or other computer for CS367. There are two ways to use home or other computer. You can use telnet to connect to the lab computers from a remote location. This provides you with the convenience of working on CS367 from your home, office, or other location without the expense of buying your own compiler. The second option is to use a home or other computer to develop your programs on a different compiler such as Borland C++. Using Telnet for Remote Access You can remotely login to your computer science account on the lab machines. In this manner you are using the other computer as a terminal to connect to the lab computers. On a UNIX machine you would enter: telnet vega22.cs.wisc.edu to connect to the lab computer named vega22. This software provides a program named telnet, and you will need to edit the site list to add the addresses of the computer science lab machines. I compile the sample code provided using version 2.7.2 of the Gnu g++ compiler, the same compiler you would use with your computer science account. If you are developing your programs on another computer than those provided in the labs you must follow these requirements: You must compile and run your program in your computer science UNIX account before handing in each program. Problems with home or other equipment or software are your responsibility and are not accepted as an excuse. When you use other computers, you are responsible for keeping backups of your work, and resolving any problems with the system. I will only guarantee that software I provide will work with your computer science accounts, but experience has shown there are few, if any problems, if you are using a recent C++ compiler. Watch the on-line information for updates. Read your e-mail. Copyright © 1996 James D. Skrentny, skrentny@cs.wisc.edu",
