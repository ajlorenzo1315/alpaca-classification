CS100 Introduction to Computer Programming An introduction to elementary computer programming concepts. Emphasis is on techniques of problem analysis and the development of algorithms and programs. The subject of the course is programming, not a particular programming language. CS211 Computers and Programming Intermediate programming in a high-level language and introduction to computer science. Topics include program development, proofs of program correctness, program structure, recursion, abstract data types, object- oriented programming, data structures, and analysis of algorithms. C++ is the principal programming language. CS212 Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs A challenging introduction to programming languages and computer science. Topics include recursive and higher-order procedures, performance analysis of algorithms, proofs of program correctness, probabilistic algorithms, symbolic hierarchical data, abstract data types, polymorphic functions, object-oriented programming, infinite data types, simulation, and the interpretation and compilation of programs. CS222 Introduction to Scientific Computation An introduction to elementary numerical analysis and scientific computation. CS418  Practicum in Computer Graphics Programming assignments dealing with interactive computer graphics and visualization of scientific data. CS482 Introduction to Analysis of Algorithms Techniques used in the creation and analysis of algorithms. CS512 Advanced Language Implementation This class will survey modern techniques for efficient implementation of advanced programming languages, such as SML, Java, Haskell, Scheme, and Modula-3. CS514  Practical in Distributed Systems Practical issues in designing and implementing distributed software. CS515  Practicum in Distributed Systems If you were using a Java enabled browser, you would have seen some animated text scrolling by here. Projects are available in the area of distributed agents, network and resource management, fundamental network protocol research, hot new network protocols, real-time communication, distributed virtual reality, Java & distribution, Java applications, CSCW, distributed simulations, distributed data management and distributed multiplayer games. The CS516 Web page contains all lecture notes, problems sets, and readings available electronically. CS612 Software Design for High-Performance Architectures Sophisticated software technology is required to exploit the enormous computing power of modern high performance architectures like pipelined, VLIW, superscalar and parallel architectures. We emphasize technology relevant to computational science applications, such as dense and sparse matrix techniques, and iterative and direct solvers, using these as examples throughout the course. CS674 Natural Language Understanding This course is an introduction to natural language understanding, a subfield of artificial intelligence whose primary concern is the computational study of language use.",
