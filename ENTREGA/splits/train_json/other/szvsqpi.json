    "Cuerpo": "As a student in the CS department, you will be given an account so that you can have access to the computer network in the department. Before activating your account, you need to familiarize yourself with the department's Computer Use Policy as well as this document. When you first sit down at one of the computers in the CS labs, move the mouse to bring up the login screen. You will see the University of Idaho Computer Science logo and login and password prompts. Take the mouse and click on the clear button before logging in. To check disk usage, \"cd\" to your home directory and execute the command, \"du -s\". Disk usage is monitored, so if a user can't control their disk usage it will be controlled for them. Man command. One of the best commands to learn about is the \"man\" command, short for manual. To learn about the \"ls\" command, type \"man ls\". This is also where you go to get an account for the campus-wide computer network. Also remember that if you have a question and all else fails, you can send questions to help@cs.uidaho.edu or bobc@cs.uidaho.edu. Netscape is available on the CS computer network. The Department of Computer Science home page comes up. The best way to learn about netscape is to browse around and look at different students' home pages. On any  page, you can click on \"View\" (located in the menu bar at the top of the window) and then click on \"Source...\" to see how some users have built their home page. Also note that there is an item on the CS home page that refers to a UNIX tutorial. Any password that is composed only of words that can be found in a dictionary or list of words, is a password that can be broken. It is important to remember that you are not the only person using the CS computer network. If you ever have a question, please feel free to stop by and visit with the System Administrator (that's me) in room B-29 in the basement of JEB.",
