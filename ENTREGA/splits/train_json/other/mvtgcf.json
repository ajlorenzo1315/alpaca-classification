These pages are no longer maintained Try out these demos yourself (if you're running X Windows) I have implemented a prototype system to test my ideas. When system resources are plentiful, it's easy to get good response time. Fractal Explorer: generates multiple Mandelbrot fractals incrementally and concurrently, with the mouse position controlling priority among windows. Things to notice and try... Fractal Explorer Demo: First, after reading the directions for operating the program, notice that you can zoom in on a fractal while it is still refining. Today, such a feature is only implemented for those tasks that are expected to take a long time, but as system service time increases in variability this feature needs to be implemented for more and more tasks. Try zooming in on two fractal windows in rapid succession so that they are simultaneously refining their images, then move the mouse over one of them. To try the color enhancement feature, first zoom in on a part of the fractal that has little variation in color, then quickly type 'c' to re-color it. Notice that this function is run on the successive images produced by the fractal generator. The output from the fractal image generator is consumed both by a display task for the first window and by a re-coloring task whose output goes to a second display task for the other window. When a portion of the task graph becomes disconnected from a useful output (such as the display or an internal program variable), the runtime system prunes it from the graph and garbage collects its associated storage. This happens when you zoom in on a fractal that is still refining. You can't witness this at the user interface, except that the resource savings improve the performance of the tasks that you care about. Photo Album Browser Demo: Suppose you want to show a friend at lunch a particular photograph of your baby, so you pull out your mobile computer and access your home photo album via the wireless network. Given that downloading all your baby pictures would take a long time, you want a photo album browser that downloads and displays images incrementally, and that prioritizes bandwidth consumption among the photos as you search for the picture. Keep in mind that the Internet provides higher bandwidth than a wireless network. This has been implemented in an experimental setup, but is not available for demo on the Web. To observe the effect of priority, press return in the URL window to restart the downloads, then quickly open two pictures and move the mouse over the later one. Observe that the selected picture gets refined faster than the other; this is more obvious in later refinements when the resolution is finer. Notice the difference in resolution of the first picture to the right vs. the others.",
