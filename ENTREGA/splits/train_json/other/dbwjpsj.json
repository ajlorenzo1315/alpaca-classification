Hard to describe... I couldn't figure out a pattern to when they appear and disappear. -Dan Prince Rules of the Game Goal: find as many words on the board as you can in three minutes. The neighbors of a tile are the tiles bordering it in all directions - vertically, horizontally, and diagonally. If playing Euclidian, edge tiles have fewer than eight neighbors. If playing non-Euclidian, the neighbors of an edge tile are considered to \"wrap around\" the board. Entering Words Enter words either by dragging them out on the board or typing them into the text box below the board. Erroneously entered words can be deleted from the word list by selecting the mistake and pressing Delete or Backspace . When dragging out a word, you can back up by dragging over the tile just before the tail of your selection. When dragging out a word, wou can press and hold the Shift key to disable selection; this is useful when selecting wrapped words in Non-Euclidian mode. Clicking on the word list to the right of the screen displays the word on the board. Clicking on the buttons beneath the board has the following effects: \"<\" - rotates the board counter-clockwise \"-\" - flips the board vertically \">\" - rotates the board clockwise Sequence of Play When you first enter Quince, a dialog box appears asking you to provide a name for yourself and select a language (English only at first).
