Who made the key breakthroughs and how did they do it? Why Did We Write the Book? It is  the  privilege of talking with the living Isaac Newtons of Computer Science that inspired us to write Out of Their Minds . What the Critics Are Saying.... Out of Their Minds: the lives and discoveries of 15 Great Computer Scientists by Dennis Shasha and Cathy Lazere is a fascinating collection of profiles and interviews...
