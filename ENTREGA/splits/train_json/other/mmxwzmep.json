    "Cuerpo": "If you want another book to buy, there is a huge selection in the computer section of the University Bookstore. Many of the books are aimed at people who already know another programming language and who just want to learn C. Others are aimed at casual computer users who want to learn a little about programming. Still others are reference manuals for people who already know C and need more details about it. If you plan to continue in computer science, you might eventually want to buy some C books for your library. C Reference Books Reference books are different from textbooks. They are not beginner's books, but rather are terse, precise definitions of much of the language. Valuable to those of you who expect to do lots of C programming (CSE majors for example), but probably not so useful to more casual programmers. Brian W. Kernighan & Dennis M. Ritchie, The C Programming Language , Prentice Hall, 1988. Now that C is an ANSI/ISO standard, K&R is not quite as essential as it used to be, but it still highly recommended. This is the official description of the C language. To buy it directly from ANSI is a little expensive. {Caution: in some copies of the book, the left-hand p. 131 is duplicated as p.132, and the true p. 132 is missing.} What's more, when you buy the book you get a diskette with the full text of the book in HTML. A great book whose intention is to \"narrow the gap between the knowledge of industry gurus and professors on the one hand and common commercial practice on the other.\" Examples are given in Pascal and C. Much of the discussion about style and defensive programming practices is useful even for beginning programmers. Steve McGuire, Writing Solid Code: Microsoft's Techniques for Developing Bug-Free C Programs . Want To Learn C On Your Own? If you are looking for self-instruction in C, check out the reviews in The C and C++ Review of \"Teach Yourself C\" and \"New C Primer Plus, 2nd ed. This is a very nice compilation of tutorials, book reviews and other C stuff. The C FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) List: A great source of C lore.",
