Breadth courses and Depth courses Send us your course comments or questions! Masters Students: Thesis Option or Not? Students who like research, are thinking of doing a PhD, or who just want to stay in school a little longer should consider the thesis option. If you just want to get a degree and get a job, you probably want the non-thesis option. Send us your comments or questions! A huge collection of advice for graduate students in CS is available at CMU . If you don't feel that your advisor is somewhat of a friend or supporter, then the path to a PhD will be rough. If you want to graduate, you will need to put yourself in position to do so. There are also local chapters of systers. Send mail to utcs-systers-request and austin-systers-request to get on the local mailing lists. $$$$$ Funding $$$$$ Most PhD students in the department will be a TA for at least one or two semesters during their graduate career. TA positions are usually available to any PhD student. The hope, of course, is that your advisor will get a big research grant that will support you as an RA for your graduate career. You can help yourself by investigating research funding opportunities and learning how to write grant proposals. If you want to save time formatting your thesis, use the thesis format, but be aware that double-spacing and wide margins will turn your document into a 40-60 page paper. In the first place, if you don't pass your thesis proposal it reflects worse on your advisor than it does on you, because it means that he/she sent you in unprepared. This is not likely to happen, especially if you practice your talk a lot. Send us your comments on the proposal! This may affect your choice of a thesis advisor.",
