Howe All About Nick Howe (at least, more than you ever really wanted to know...) Home address: 118 Schuyler Place #2 Ithaca , NY 14850 (607) 256-0724 The Brief Story Of My Life: I was born in Port Jefferson, Long Island on December 30, 1970 (or so I am told.) I went to college at Princeton University where I majored in physics . Graduating in 1993, I joined the Teach for America program and spent two years teaching at a small rural public high school in Arkansas . Links to Other Family Members and Friends: Both of my parents are employed at Yale University . My mother works at the medical school . My sister is a junior at Columbia University . (Send them a resume if you like what you see!) Matt Leary doesn't have a page, but his fiancee Hillary does. Alex Reutter has a very cool page. I am a former director of PrinceCon , a production of the Simulation Games Union . Although I try to deny it, I was occasionally seen with that orange-and-black-plaid monstrosity, the Band . I also had lots of friends in the Wildcats , a cool a capella group. Tarot - well, the graphics look neat, anyway. Meyers-Briggs Personality Test - I'm an INTJ . What's your sign? SPAM Haikus, etc. - just what you've been looking for! The Zipper - find out how to bug your representative in Congress. Inktomi - a fast search engine. Named after a Native American myth .",
