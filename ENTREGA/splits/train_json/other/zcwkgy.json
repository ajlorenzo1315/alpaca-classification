    "Cuerpo": "VisAD Home Page Introduction VisAD is a system for visualizing and interactively steering scientifc computations. It provides: * An interactive computational environment combining a flexible interpreted language with linkages to Fortran and C. * A data model that lets users design data types appropriate to their applications. VisAD includes a large number of example programs and data sets that demonstrate its flexibility. While it has been developed primarily to meet the needs of environmental scientists, its flexibility makes it useful to any scientists who develop algorithms or use computers to analyze data. Later versions will be ported to other vendors' workstations. VisAD was written by the Visualization Project at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Space Science and Engineering Center (SSEC) by Bill Hibbard and Brian Paul . How to get VisAD VisAD is available by anonymous ftp. The latest version of VisAD is in visad.1.1.tar.Z .
