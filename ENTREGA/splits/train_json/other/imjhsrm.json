Newcomers to Pittsburgh are probably accustomed to the first set. Not honking unnecessarily, as it upsets other drivers. Not having a claim to the parking space on the street in front of your house. Using a supermarket cart to take your groceries to your car in the parking lot. Not nosing around in your neighbors' affairs. When Pittsburghers go abroad (that is, out of Southwestern Pennsylvania), they follow the Correct rules of conduct. As a result, native residents will almost always choose to follow the Reasonable set when they are at home. In the presence of this Axiom, the examples above change slightly, and could be read: Since the first car going in the opposite direction at the intersection is a close personal friend of yours, he won't mind your saving some time and running through as soon as the light turns green, instead of waiting until the end of the traffic cycle. Honk to say ``Hi'' to the friend you see walking along the sidewalk. No one will mind, since he is their friend as well. Your friend will not mind your blocking his driveway. After all, you willl only be there a few minutes. Everyone in town gets a parking space, so why shouldn't you? It's a long walk back to your house, so you'll just borrow the shopping cart from your good friend the manager of the local Giant Eagle. You will bring it back next time you go, or maybe one of your friendly neighbors will do it for you. Since you are a close personal friend of your neighbor, you should pay special attention to his private affairs, so that you can help him out in times of trouble. Everybody knows where you're going, so why should you use turn signals? Excerpted from: Reid & Rich; Guide to Living in Pittsburgh, 7th ed. ; CMU CS; July 1991; p.  4. pierce@cs.cornell.edu",
