Even though this standard was developed with still images in mind, it is also used for video transmission by providing intraframe compression only (often referred to as motion JPEG). The most widely used mode of JPEG is the baseline mode which is a subset of the sequential encoding based on the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). The pixel values in each such block are first level-shifted from unsigned to signed integers and then input to the forward DCT. These quantized coefficients are then entropy encoded, with the DC coefficients being treated specially. The coefficients are first run-length encoded and then coded using Huffman or arithmetic coding. The Hierarchical Mode of the JPEG Standard The hierarchical encoding mode of JPEG (HJPEG) encodes an image at multiple resolutions, each differing from its adjacent level by a factor of two in the horizontal or vertical directions, or both. For sequential DCT-based HJPEG this new reduced size image (called a frame in JPEG terminology) is encoded using the sequential mode described previously. This upsampled image is then used as a prediction of the original image at this resolution and the difference image is computed. Difference between Progressive Mode and Hierarchical Mode In the progressive mode, the 8x8 DCT coefficients blocks are encoded in multiple scans. Two procedures, spectral selection and successive approximation , are defined for encoding the quantized coefficients in the buffer. Successive approximation  encodes  the most significant bits in the first scan and then the less significant bits in each subsequent scan. Both the progressive and the hierarchical mode allow the progression of image, from coarse to refined. Heterogeneous end user devices :  When a user has a low resolution display device, a maximum resolution for that device is always possible without receiving unnecessary data for higher resolution if the hierarchical mode is used. In the case of the progressive mode, a user can still see the progression of an image, however, the total transmission time is fixed for the full-resolution. However, the separation of an image by layer for storing in a different storage device is not justified in the progressive mode, since a progression up to full-resolution may be necessary regardless of image sizes. Note also that the hierarchical mode can use other modes of JPEG for the progression. Thus, even a finer granularity of the progression is possible if the progressive mode is used  instead of sequential mode. On the other hand, the progressive mode of JPEG does not have any overhead in bit rate over the sequential mode of JPEG, whereas the hierarchical mode does. \"The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard,\" Communications of the ACM , 34(4):30--44, July 1991.",
