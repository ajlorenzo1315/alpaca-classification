The array should have 26 elements - one for each letter of the alphabet. char int_to_char (int n) { return n + 'a'; } These functions rely on the fact that characters are really just integers, and the compiler will translate from one to the other automatically. Your program should go through the entire input string character-by-character, and if it is a letter, add 1 to the count stored in the element of the array that corresponds to that letter. Only work on these after you can actually print out a simple histogram! Scaling the Bar Chart If any character occurs more than 50 times, you must scale all of the bars in the chart so that the longest bar is printed with 50 stars. You should also print out the scaling factor. 26 letters scale factor: 0.480769 The scaling factor is just 1.0 if the most frequent character occurs at most 50 times. You would then multiply this scaling factor by the frequency of each character to compute the number of stars to print. Information is passed in and out of the the functions via the parameters and return value. No function may contain more than one loop. All functions must be documented using comments. It should ask the user for the name of the file, read the file, and use this as the input. Fortunately, this should be really easy, since I am providing you with a function that reads an entire file as a single string. The function has the following prototype: string read_file (string filename) This function reads the file filename and returns its contents as a single string. If there was an error (for example, the file didn't exist) then it returns the empty string. The read_file function is defined in the object file r:\\public\\mbirk\\readfile.obj . This means that you will have to add this to the Project Window. Do not hand these in.",
