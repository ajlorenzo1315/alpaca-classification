    "Cuerpo": "It should be 3-4 times the size and effort of a normal class project, as you can devote the entire course time to it. The project goal is for you and your partners to explore an aspect of Java or Java implementations deeply, so that (a) you learn more about doing research, and (b) teach the class and your professors something new. You will be graded on how well your team define a problem, surveys previous work, designs and conducts experiments, and presents your results. We recommend three partners (and require at least two) to provide you with experience in working with a team, which is valuable in research projects and product groups. Proposals turned in earlier will get earlier feedback. Proposals should be about one-two pages long and include: (1) a description of your topic, (2) a statement of why you think the topic is interesting or important, (3) a description of the methods you will use to evaluate your ideas, and (4) a references to at least three sources of information pertinent to your topic. Midterm status meetings during the week of November 4-8, 1996. You will meet with one or both of the professors for about 15 minutes to informally present the status of your project and a weekly plan for completing it. Details for scheduling meetings will be made available later via the class mailing list. Project talks during week of December 9-13, 1996. All group members should deliver part of the talk. The talk should present highlights of the final report, including the problem, motivation, results, conclusions, and possible future work. Please, practice your talk!
