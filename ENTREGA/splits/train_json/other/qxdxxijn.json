    "Cuerpo": "However, they do NOT know the specifics of what is taught in your section, or the style and format preferences of your instructor or grader. Also, they do not know the details of your assignments, but can access that information on-line if needed. Consultants are on duty to help students with problems, as well as other duties . They will do their best to answer your questions and explain solutions. Questions about the logic of a program or function are sometimes best answered by your instructor. The amount of time a consultant can spend on a lengthy answer is also dependent on how many other students are waiting with questions. Consultants are stationed in the PC lab CS1350. If needed, you may go to the printer room to ask that consultant questions about CS302. If the PC lab is not busy, consultants may be working at a PC that will have a sign on top indicating that they are a consultant. When the PC lab is busy and there are no PCs available for you, consultants will logout and make their PC available to you. Consultants are on duty Monday-Friday 8am-10pm, Saturday 12pm-8pm, and Sunday 12pm-10pm (see the schedule for details). If you have a question, raise your hand and a consultant will come over. What is appreciated, is a clear description of your problem and a brief description of what you have tried to solve your problem. It will help you become a better and more self-reliant programmer (Remember you will not have the help of a consultant during an exam!). At times when the lab is busy and many students have questions, it is difficult to insure that students are helped in the correct order. You may even find, with the help of the debugger, that you can solve your problem. At times when the lab isn't busy and a consultant is using a PC, it is better to go over to the consultant and ask your question. In fact at any time when a consultant is not helping another student, feel free to go over and tap on the consultant's shoulder to ask for help. We would like your comments, suggestions, or complaints about the lab and/or consultants. Feedback may be provided by clicking here or by contacting Jim Skrentny, CS302 Coordinator (CS 1303, 262-0191, skrentny@cs).",
