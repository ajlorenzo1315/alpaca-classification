You can get the full source distribution of Emacs, or you can get an installed distribution of Emacs with all executables precompiled. I don't want the precompiled version. Edit the emacs.bat file to change the emacs_dir environment variable to point to the Emacs installation directory and invoke the emacs.bat file to run Emacs. For example, there should be a file lisp\\term\\win32-win.el; if this has been truncated to win32-wi.el, your distribution has been corrupted while unpacking and Emacs will not start. If you have Emacs frames with specific names, you can also specify a font for that frame. With default-frame-alist , we set the top left corner of new frames to be at pixel offset +200+400, the width and height to be 80x40, the cursor to be white, the foreground to be yellow, the background to be black, and the font to be Courier 10. Although you cannot change the size, font, or color of the window from within Emacs, you can use the window's menu to do so. Select \"Fonts...\", and use the dialog to set the window font to the one you want. The implication of this is that, if you use command.com under Win95 as your shell, then you can only run one shell process at a time (command.com is still a DOS process even under Win95). How do I use a shell in Emacs? You should either explicitly set the environment variable SHELL to be the shell you want to use, or, if you want to have the COMSPEC environment variable determine the shell, then you need to install Emacs using the addpm.exe program and ensure that the SHELL environment variable is not defined when you start up Emacs. You can do this by setting the explicit- SHELL -args variable appropriately, where SHELL is the value of your shell environment variable (do a \"M-: (getenv \"SHELL\")\" to see what it is currently set to). Assuming that you are on NT and that your SHELL environment variable is set to cmd.exe, then placing the following in your startup file will tell cmd.exe to not echo commands: (setq explicit-cmd.exe-args '(\"/q\")) The comint package will use the value of this variable as an argument to cmd.exe every time it starts up a new shell (as in shell-mode); the /q is the argument to cmd.exe that stops the echoing (in a shell, invoking \"cmd /?\" The fix for this is to either prevent any arguments from being sent to the shell when it starts up (in which case command.com will use a default, and correct, value for COMSPEC), or to have the first argument be the directory in which the shell executable resides. If you want to use these functions, download and place untranslate.el in your load-path and have it loaded from your startup file. I don't have any source.) \"emacs -nw\" doesn't work.",
