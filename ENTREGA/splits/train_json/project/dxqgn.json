This work is the result of a collaboration at the University of Wisconsin-Madison between Prof. Olvi L. Mangasarian of the Computer Sciences Department and Dr. William H. Wolberg of the departments of Surgery and Human Oncology. In collaboration with Prof. Mangasarian and two of his graduate students, Rudy Setiono and Kristin Bennett , a classifier was constructed using the multisurface method (MSM) of pattern separation on these nine features that successfully diagnosed 97% of new cases. The image analysis work began in 1990 with the addition of Nick Street to the research team. The goal was to diagnose the sample based on a digital image of a small section of the FNA slide. The results of this research have been consolidated into a software system known as Xcyt , which is currently used by Dr. Wolberg in his clinical practice. A portion of the slide in which the cells are well-differentiated is then scanned using a digital camera and a frame-grabber board. Prognosis The second problem considered in this research is that of prognosis, the prediction of the long-term behavior of the disease. By examining the actual recurrence of those training cases with similar predicted recurrence times, we can plot the probability of disease-free survival for various times (out to 10 years) for an individual patient.
