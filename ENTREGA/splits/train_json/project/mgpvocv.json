    "Cuerpo": "As a result, there is no support available other than users helping each other on the amanda-users mailing list. The Kerberos support is available as a separate add-on package - see the file KERBEROS.HOW-TO-GET on the ftp site. More details are available in docs/WHATS.NEW. WHAT IS AMANDA? Amanda is a backup system designed to archive many computers on a network to a single large-capacity tape drive. will back up multiple machines in parallel to a holding disk, blasting finished dumps one by one to tape as fast as we can write files to tape. For example, a ~2 Gb 8mm tape on a ~240K/s interface to a host with a large holding disk can be filled by Amanda in under 4 hours. supports tape changers via a generic interface. The Kerberos support is available as a separate add-on package, see the file KERBEROS.HOW-TO-GET on the ftp site, and the file docs/KERBEROS in this package, for more details. for a restore, tells you what tapes you need, and finds the proper backup image on the tape for you. All the computers you are going to dump are the \"backup client hosts\". The holding disk allows Amanda to run backups in parallel to the disk, only writing them to tape when the backup is finished. Note that the holding disk is not required: without it Amanda will run backups sequentially to the tape drive. Actually, Amanda will still work if you have full dumps that are larger than the holding disk: Amanda will send those dumps directly to tape one at a time. Amanda should run on any modern Unix system that supports dump, has sockets and inetd, and either system V shared memory, or BSD mmap implemented. We only run the server side under SunOS 4.1.3, but it compiles on all those platforms, and I have no reason at this time to beleive it will not work. NextStep HOW DO I GET AMANDA UP AND RUNNING? I do maintain the following mailing lists for those interested in Amanda: ==> To join a mailing list, DO NOT, EVER, send mail to that list. This package and related files are available via anonymous FTP from ftp.cs.umd.edu in the pub/amanda directory. amanda-hackers The amanda-hackers mailing list is for discussion of the technical details of the Amanda package, including extensions, ports, bugs, fixes, and alpha testing of new versions.",
