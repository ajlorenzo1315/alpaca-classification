SodaBot is a research project of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab aimed at simplifying the construction of software agents . It is part of the lab's Intelligent Room project. View the (somewhat outdated) SodaBot slide show ! If you don't know what a software agent is, you should click here before proceeding! The SodaBot System: The Philosophy: Software agents should be written using a vocabulary not provided by traditional programming languages --- it should be possible to create agents solely by specifying their abstract behavior. Its primary component is the basic software agent --- a computational framework for building agents which is essentially an agent operating system . We also present a new language for programming the basic software agent whose primitives are designed around human-level descriptions of agent activity. Software agents are technically challenging to write in traditional programming languages. Writing agents requires large amounts of esoteric system-hacking knowledge, e.g., of network communication, reliable transaction protocols, etc. SodaBot provides: A universal computational framework -- the Basic Software Agent -- for creating and using agent applications. A graphic user-interface Automatic distribution of software agents across the Internet. & SodaBot is in use at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab. It is being developed by Michael Coen and Joshua Kramer under the auspices of the HCI group . SodaBot is currently undergoing limited-distribution beta-testing. Source code is not yet publically available. To find out more about SodaBot: View the SodaBot slide show! September, 1994. SodaBot: A Software Agent Environment and Construction System .
