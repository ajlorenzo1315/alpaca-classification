The starting point of the ESM model is the UCLA AGCM , which has been parallelized on different platforms and will be coupled with GATOR, a Gas, Aerosol, Transport, and Radiation Chemistry model, developed by M. Jacobson, O. Toon, R. Turco, and R. Lu. Coupled systems are an important tool for helping scientists to understand complex phenomena such as El Nino and stratospheric ozone depletion. A parallel version of GATOR is being developed at Berkeley by Jim Demmel and Sharon Smith . Since the UCLA ESM is still evolving, it is important that the codes also be portable, so our efforts are thus focused on developing portable, parallel code that can be performance tuned for different parallel architectures. The main challenges in parallelizing GATOR are overcoming problems due to load imbalance and minimizing the communication costs. The figure below shows the differences in computation that can result in load imbalance: In the picture, the z-axis shows time, while the x and y axis show the latitudinal and longitudinal partitioning of the atmosphere into block columns. The largest amount of computation occurs in parts of the globe that are in the summer and daylight, whereas the processors holding atmospheric cells in winter and night require the least amount of computation. Click here to see the ODE solver computation costs for the world. Our solution to the load balancing problem is to use a block-cyclic layout which will collect different atmospheric cells from the different parts of the globe together in a single processor. The hope is that each processor will have cells requiring different amounts of computation, but not all of the computationally intensive cells at once. Performance Modeling and the ESM Throughout the design of the parallel implementation of GATOR, we used a timing model to help choose between different design alternatives that would benefit GATOR both as a stand-alone system and as part of the UCLA AGCM. The results of this work are reported in: J. Demmel and S. L. Smith. , pages 718--725, Knoxville, TN., May 1994. Performance of a parallel global atmospheric chemical tracer model. Submitted to Supercomputing 95 . EOSDIS We are extending our modeling effort to help explore an architecture for the Earth Observing System (EOS) . The project involves researchers at the Berkeley , Los Angeles , San Diego , and Santa Barbara campuses of the University of California.
