The applicability and robustness of our results and others are being investigated. Or, from the EECS Dept. This project is developing new methods for analyzing structured vector quantizers. These new methods have lead to the successful analysis of several structured vector quantizers, including tree-structured and two-stage quantizers. Model-Based Digital Image Halftoning Professor:  D. L. Neuhoff New model-based approaches to halftoning are being developed. Image Coding Gracuate Students:  M. Horowitz, M. Slyz Professor:  D. L. Neuhoff Image coding is the process of creating binary image representations with the dual goals of efficiency (as few bits as possible in the representation) and accuracy (the reproduced images shall be as similar as possible to the original). Performance and Complexity of CDMA Networks with Coded-Modulation Graduate Students:  M. Klimesh, W. Sung Professors:  W. Stark and J. T. Coffey Sponsors:  National Science Foundation There are two parts of this research project. In this work we have derived transmission and decoding strategies that allows for maximum information transmission or minimum error probability. The performance of a maximum likelihood decoding algorithm against the worst case jammer can be improved. Worst case interference is derived as well as the resulting performance. Within this area a number of current topics are being investigated, such as the design of minimal trellises for block codes, fundamental limits for decoders with a reduced number of states, decoding algorithms for time-varying channels, and so on. Our preliminary results indicate that for a nonselective channel larger spreading improves performance in spite of the fact that more of the received energy is treated as interference rather than part of a faded signal. Communicating Over Power Lines Graduate Student:  Y-P. Wang Professor:  W. Stark The goal of this research is to investigate different alternatives for transmitting data over a power line. Optical Communications and Very Noisy Channels Graduate Student:  S. Lee Professor:  K. A. Winick A very noisy channel is a channel whose capacity is close to zero. For most channels, the error exponent is not known and can only be bounded. Distance Bounds for Runlength-Constrained Codes Graduate Student:  S-H. Yang Professor:  K.  A. Winick One of the most basic problems in coding theory is to find the largest code of a given length and minimum distance. The first filter to be demonstrated will compensate for dispersion-induced pulse spreading in optical fibers. Recently, the development of rare earth-doped fiber lasers has received considerable attention. Glass waveguide lasers on planar substrates are a natural extension of the fiber technology.",
