    "Cuerpo": "Our focus is on uniprocessor systems. Mission The goals of the Massively Scalar Compiler Project are to develop new techniques in code optimization and code generation that represent real improvements over existing methods, to transfer this knowledge to industrial compiler groups in a way that enables them to quickly evaluate and deploy new methods, and to implement and distribute a laboratory compiler that can serve as a testbed for evaluating new techniques in code optimization and code generation. Our primary focus is on problems that arise for uniprocessor, microprocessor-based systems. We try to ensure that our techniques work equally well in multiprocessor systems. This work is supported by both ARPA and the State of Texas. Problems that we attack In general, we investigate problems that arise in compiling code for uniprocessor microprocessor-based systems. Methodology As a group, we have a strong belief in the development of new algorithms coupled with experimental evaluation. We view research and development as two halves of a whole effort. It is our intent to build a reference implementation for each new technique that proves its worth; these are written in nuweb , a literate programming tool. Personnel The group scaling a massive object The Massively Scalar Compiler Project is led by four researchers Keith D. Cooper Ken Kennedy Taylor Simpson Linda Torczon The prime reason that these people are productive is because they have a supporting cast of staff and graduate students . Software One of the prime work products of the project is software. As a phase of the compiler achieves a semblance of stability and maturity, we place it into the pool of released software. The code is available (in nuweb form) via anonymous ftp. The compiler uses a low-level intermediate language named ILOC. We hope that someone learns from our experience! Preston Briggs of Tera Computers and Cliff Click of Hewlett-Packard are both recent graduates. We publish papers on our work in several different venues. For more information, we have a brief summary of results available online. Overhead transparencies and poster materials from the Spring 96 ARPA PI meeting are also archived online.
