DisLoP: a research project on Disjunctive Logic Programming Funding * Persons * Activities * Publications * Related Projects * Related Links T he long term goal of this project is to develop a logic programming system in which disjunction in the head of a clause and non-monotonic negation in the body of the clause are allowed. Ulrich Furbach and Dr. Jürgen Dix . Two research scientists Dr. Ilkka Niemelä and Dr. Chandrabose Aravindan are working exculsively on this project. The group presented a poster at the poster session of JICSLP '96 The group presented a system description at KI '96 The group is organizing LPNMR '97 .
