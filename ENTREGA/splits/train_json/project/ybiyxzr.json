CASHMERe attempts to bridge the performance gap between shared memory emulations on networks of workstations and tightly-coupled cache-coherent multiprocessors while using minimal hardware support. In the context of CASHMERe we have discovered that NCC-NUMA (Non Cache Coherent Non Uniform Memory Access) machines can greatly improve the performance of DSM systems , and approach that of fully hardware coherent multiprocessors . The basic property of NCC-NUMA systems is the ability to access remote memory directly; such a capability is offered by a variety of network interfaces including DEC's Memory Channel, HP's Hamlyn, and the Princeton Shrimp . The department of Computer Science at the University of Rochester is building a 32 processor Cashmere prototype . The prototype consists of eight 4-processor DEC 2100 4/233 multiprocessors on a Memory Channel network. Cashmere augments the functionality of the Memory Channel by providing cache coherence in software.
