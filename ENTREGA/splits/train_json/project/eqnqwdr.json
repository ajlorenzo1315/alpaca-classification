Databases should model the data using the abstraction of sequences , allow data sequences to be queried in a declarative manner , utilizing the ordered semantics take advantage of the unique opportunities available for query optimization and evaluation integrate sequence data with relational data, so that users can store and query a combination of relation and sequences These requirements serve as the goals of the SEQ project. Various kinds of sequences need to be supported, temporal sequences being the most important kind. Project Status The current status of the project is: We have defined the SEQ data model that can support most important kinds of sequence data. We have also defined algebraic query operators that can be composed to form sequence queries (analogous to the composition of relational algebra operators to form relation queries). We have described how sequence queries can be efficiently processed, and have identified various optimization techniques. It is built over the SHORE storage manager and can process several megabytes of data. The key to such optimization is the sequentiality of the data and the query. Data Model The details of the SEQ data model are described in a published paper (click here for postscript version). The basic model of a sequence is a set of records mapped to an ordered domain of ``positions''. The advantage is that this makes it easy to model queries involving sequence collections (which is the case in many real-world situations). All the sequence operators are extended to work with groups of similar sequences, instead of with single sequences. Sequin Query Language We have devised a query language called Sequin using which declarative sequence queries can be specified. The language is similar in flavor to SQL, except that the inputs to queries as well as the results of queries are sequences. Optimization Techniques We have proposed new optimization techniques for sequence queries involving Positional operators. There are existing techniques that have been proposed for queries with Record-Oriented operators. Both Sequin and a subset of SQL are supported as query languages which can be embedded inside each other. For more details on the SEQ system, click here .
