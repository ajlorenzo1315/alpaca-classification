    "TÃ­tulo": "The Distributed Supercomputer Supernet (SSN)",
    "Cuerpo": "The geographic coverage ranges from interdepartmental to campus and even to metropolitan areas. The network provides very high speed multiple services, supporting hybrid circuit-switched and datagram traffic, and direct or multi-hop connections that are dynamically reconfigurable. At a first networking level, we locally interconnect workstations, supercomputers, peripheral devices, mass memory etc. At a higher networking level, we use fully optical interconnects, allowing communication between devices connected to distinct mesh routers. A goal of this research is to capture the large, latent, distributed computational power of the network processors, to be used for network control and management, leading to an intelligent network. A main motivation for the research stems from the limitations observed in current supercomputer interconnect systems, and from the opportunities offered by emerging communication technologies such as WDM optoelectronics for novel, feasible system architectures. APPROACH: We propose to overcome the usual interconnect problems by replacing the point-to-point links with an all-optical interconnect system. Namely, the high speed LANS will be connected to an optical star (or tree) \"physical\" topology. WDM channels (supporting also time division multiplexing) will be established between modules, thus defining a dense \"virtual\" interconnection topology, which is dynamically reconfigurable, responding to changing traffic patterns. A pool of channels will be set aside for direct, end-to-end connections between mesh routers, providing circuit-switched service for real-time traffic applications. The heart of the Distributed Supercomputer Supernet is OPTIMIC - OPTical Interconnect of MyriNet IC chips. OPTIMIC is a novel, high-performance network consisting of Myricom asynchronous pipeline crossbars (APC) interconnected by a WDM optical backbone. In OPTIMIC, each network node (i.e. APC) is connected to local hosts, to other nodes, and to multiple optical channels via an Optical Channel Interface (OCI). TECHNOLOGY TRANSITION: Among the technology transfer possibilities for the research, we list the following. Real Time Distributed Network Operating System: Low and predictable (bounded) latency makes ideal for wide area network control and data acquisition applications. Distributed Image Data Base Perusal: Scientific image-based data-base archival and perusal systems are now being developed in several efforts, such as the UC Sequoia effort and the MAGIC testbed. NASA applications, such as EOS will require the capability of perusing through terabytes of data very quickly and interactively. Click here for the SSN Status Report.
