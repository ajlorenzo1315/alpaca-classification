    "Cuerpo": "These tools are consistent with the Ada 95 Distributed Systems Annex , and have been designed for use with the NYU GNU Ada 95 compiler ( GNAT ). ADEPT includes a graphical tool for partitioning and configuring Ada 95 distributed programs (the PCT), which runs on Sun Sparcs running the Solaris 2.4 and 2.5 operating systems. Untested sources for a Windows NT version of the PCS are also available. Because of the increasing interest in the use of Java, the distributed Ada programs were connected to a Java application that performed all the graphical display tasks. This is believed to be the first demonstration of a distributed application comprising Ada and Java components. This means that a Java client may use the Java Remote Method Invocation to call distributed/remote objects that have been created using Annex E in an Ada server. The use of Ada and Java in these roles may provide the basis for solving many of the distributed application problems of the future. Contents: ADEPT project team Availability Introduction to ADEPT ADEPT example Related links Availability The following ADEPT units are available. ADEPT for Sun Solaris and GNAT 3.05: tarfile (5 Mb to download, 12 Mb uncompressed). Includes Posix 1003.5, and untested sources for Windows NT. ADEPT for Sun Solaris and GNAT 3.04: tarfile (6 Mb to download, 15 Mb uncompressed). Includes Posix 1003.5, and untested sources for Windows NT. Posix 1003.5: tarfile (180 Kb to download, 370 Kb uncompressed). Posix 1003.5 is the Ada 83 binding for the POSIX System Application Program Interface. As part of the Adept project, Posix 1003.5 was PARTIALLY implementated. ADEPT sources only: tarfile (940 Kb to download, ~3 Mb uncompressed.) Includes all of the above, for GNAT 3.04.
