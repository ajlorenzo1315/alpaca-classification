A draft of the ScaLAPACK Users' Guide and a comprehensive Installation Guide is provided, as well as test suites for all ScaLAPACK , PBLAS , and BLACS routines. PARPACK (Parallel ARPACK) is an extension of the ARPACK software package used for solving large scale eigenvalue problems on distributed memory parallel architectures. An extensive set of driver routines are available for ARPACK and a subset of these are available for parallel computation with PARPACK . CAPSS is a fully parallel package to solve a sparse linear system of the form Ax=b on a message passing multiprocessor; the matrix A is assumed to be symmetric positive definite and associated with a mesh in two or three dimensions. #       The URL for the BLACS is http://www.netlib.org/blacs/index.html. #       A URL for MPI is http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/. #       ############# #       # ScaLAPACK # #       ############# ,\t(Prebuilt libraries are available on this index and in the ,\tBLACS directory on netlib.) file scalapack/scalapack_ug.ps.gz for\tPRELIMINARY DRAFT:  ScaLAPACK Users' Guide (200 pages) ,\tDate:  November 17, 1996 size\t404591 bytes file scalapack/errata.scalapack for\tERRATA file for ScaLAPACK. file scalapack/pblasqref.ps for\tPBLAS Quick Reference Guide size\t93299 bytes file scalapack/pumma_blacs.uue for\t(FOR ANON FTP, email via NETLIB, or XNETLIB USERS) ,\tThis is the BLACS version of PUMMA, version 2.1. ,\t(this file has been tar; compress; uuencode) ,\tUpdated:  July, 1995 size\t318504 bytes lang\tFortran gams\td1b6 file scalapack/pumma_picl.uue for\t(FOR ANON FTP, email via NETLIB, or XNETLIB USERS) ,\tThis is the PICL version of PUMMA, version 2.1. ,\t(this file has been tar; compress; uuencode) ,\tUpdated:  March 24, 1995 size\t318767 bytes lang\tFortran gams\td1b6 file scalapack/readme.arpack for\tA README file for the ARPACK distribution ,\tARPACK is a Fortran 77 software package for solving large scale ,\teigenvalue problems. file scalapack/instructions.arpack for\tInstallation instructions for ARPACK.
