    "Cuerpo": "Several monographs and surveys have documented the basic theory, algorithms, and applications of complementarity problems and their role in optimization theory. This page serves as a center for information regarding research in complementarity problems. As such there is a listing of meetings of interest to the community, some pointers to software for complementarity problems as well as links to other pages of interest. Table of Contents Directory of Researchers in Complementarity Software for Complementarity Problems Applications of Complementarity Relevant Web Links Directory of Complementarity Researchers Software for Complementarity Problems MCPLIB: A collection of nonlinear mixed complementarity problems, problem description, and how to access the GAMS source files for these problems. The PATH solver is also available in this toolbox, more details below. Contact steve@gams.com, rutherford@colorado.edu or ferris@cs.wisc.edu for further details. MILES is an extension of the classical Josephy-Newton method for NCP in which the solution to each linearized subproblem is computed via Lemke's almost-complementary pivot algorithm. This Newton point is used to define the Newton direction, which is then used in a damped linesearch. MILES also employs a restart procedure in cases where the Newton point cannot be computed due to termination in a secondary ray. The algorithm consists of a sequence of major iterations, each consisting of an approximation or linearization step similar to that of MILES, the construction of a path to the Newton point (the solution to the approximation), and a possible search of this path. When the Newton point does not exists or the path cannot be entirely constructed, a step along the partially computed path is taken before the problem is relinearized. A nonmonotone watchdog strategy is employed in applying the path search; this helps avoid convergence to local minima of the norm function for the underlying nonsmooth equation and keeps the number of function evaluations required as small as possible. A list of solver options is given in the document NE/SQP: The NE/SQP algorithm is based upon reformulating the NCP as a system of nonsmooth equations. The nonsmoothness of the equations is handled using directional derivatives of H. SMOOTH The SMOOTH algorithm is based upon reformulating the NCP as a system of nonsmooth equations and then approximately solving a sequence of smooth approximations, which lead to a zero of the nonsmooth system. This is implemented as a GAMS/MCP system. Other solvers have been implemented as subsystems of GAMS and are compared in this paper. Applications of Complementarity Engineering and Economic Applications of Complementarity Problems . This paper lists many of the known applications of complementarity problems.
