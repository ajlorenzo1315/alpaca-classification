Several of the algorithms underlying the Coral system have been developed by members of the group during the duration of the project (since 1988). Overview: Coral is a deductive system which supports a rich declarative language, and an interface to C++ which allows for a combination of declaritive and imperative programming. CORAL also has an interface with C++, and users can program in a combination of declarative CORAL and C++ extended with CORAL primitives. A high degree of extensibility is provided by allowing C++ programmers to use the class structure of C++ to enhance the CORAL implemenation. CORAL provides support for both main-memory and disk-resident data. Release Information: The current release of Coral is Version 1.5, released October 10, 1996.
