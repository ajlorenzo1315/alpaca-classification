    "Cuerpo": "Our specific research currently focuses on the following areas: Examining the performance impact of large memory latencies and limited memory bandwidth in current and future microprocessor-based systems Performance modeling of the various design points along the processor/memory (P/M) integration spectrum Cache hierarchy design for P/M integrated systems Design of main memory banks in a P/M integrated system Program execution in systems with multiple integrated chips (DataScalar architectures) Galileo-specific publications: Exploiting Optical Interconnects to Eliminate Serial Bottlenecks Doug Burger and James R. Goodman. DataScalar Architectures and the SPSD Execution Model Doug Burger, Stefanos Kaxiras, and James R. Goodman. University of Wisconsin-Madison Computer Sciences Department Technical Report 1317, July, 1996. Quantifying Memory Bandwidth Limitations of Current and Future Microprocessors Doug Burger, James R. Goodman, and Alain Kägi. Appears in the 23rd International Symposium on Computer Architecture, May, 1996. The SCI standard specifies a linked-list based hardware coherence protocol, which includes support for efficient synchronization primitives (Queue On Lock Bit, or QOLB), as well as optimizations for different sharing patterns, such as pairwise-sharing and fresh read-sharing. We are currently performing SCI-related research on the following topics: Extending SCI with logarithmically-growing sharing structures Efficient hardware synchronization for shared-memory multiprocessors A scalability study of the base SCI protocol, including its standard extensions Aggressive consistency models for shared-memory multiprocessors Wisconsin SCI Publications: The GLOW Cache Coherence Protocol Extensions for Widely Shared Data Stefanos Kaxiras and James R. Goodman. To appear in the proceedings of the 10th ACM International Conference on Supercomputing, May, 1996. Techniques for Reducing Overheads of Shared-Memory Multiprocessing Alain Kägi, Nagi Aboulenein, Douglas C. Burger, and James R. Goodman. Appears as \"Best Architecture Paper\" in the proceedings of the 9th ACM International Conference on Supercomputing, July, 1995.
