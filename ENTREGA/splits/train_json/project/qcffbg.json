    "Cuerpo": "Our program is devoted to the formulation, analysis and numerical resolution of a broad class of scientific problems, drawn from aerodynamics, multi-phase flow, combustion, electromagnetic theory, nonlinear optics and materials science. One component of the CMCL involves the design of new schemes for partial differential equations, particularly those which support adaptive mesh refinement, fast algorithms, and parallel computation. A second component of our effort concerns the modeling and numerical investigation of a variety of questions in materials science, interface motion, and nonlinear optics. The third component of the CMCL involves the mathematical analysis of the phenomenology of nonlinear conservation laws and incompressible flow. People The research personnel of the CMCL consists of 7 faculty members, 9 graduate students, and several postdoctoral fellows.
