    "Cuerpo": "We are working on the design and prototyping of software, VLSI, and electro-mechanical systems. Our goal is to develop prototyping  environments in which many types of information involved in system  design can be combined in a coordinated way. We are very interested in building systems that require a heavy interdisciplinary interaction between a number of engineering disciplines. The national needs in robotics, automation, manufacturing, and intelligent systems are pushing scientists and engineers to learn more about different disciplines to be able to build coherent systems. The end product of research of this highly interdisciplinary nature would be: Prototyping environments (software and hardware) that allow the concurrent design of engineering systems (manipulators, mobile robots, electromechanical structures, MEMS, operating systems and schedulers for manufacturing applications). Actual tools, hardware and software systems, and machines. The end applications of the developed environments and platforms can range >from real-time distributed operating systems for specialized machines and electromechanical equipments, to mobile robots for specific tasks, to micro-nano sensors, actuators, and manipulators, to real-time visualizations of biological entities under outer space constraints, to process plans for manufacturing under tolerance requirements. We believe that graduating engineers, especially in the fields of computer science and engineering, and electrical engineering should have much more interdisciplinary knowledge about other engineering, physics, and mathematics areas than what they currently have, on the average. The interdisciplinary nature of our research provides an exceptional educational environment for those involved in the work. Our practice is to insure that each research associate is aware of and contributes to all aspects of the big project, not just the individual research problem he or she is working on at the time. The United States is experiencing a major economic battle in the global market place. During the past three years we have been working on the coordination and integration of the efforts of the different groups involved in the computer-aided prototyping projects at the Department of Computer Science. In particular, we are working on developing theoretical and experimental tools, environments, and systems for integrating sensing, robotics , CAD / CAM , languages , and VLSI efforts within a number of CISE projects. That project led to the SAM (Sensing for Advanced Manufacturing) project and the Feature-Based Reverse Engineering paradigm which is a huge undertaking that has been ongoing since August 1993, with four faculty and 4 - 6 students working on it, under the direction of Professors Bill Thompson , and Thomas Henderson . The CISE robot prototyping environment project resulted in a concurrent and flexible design environment for prototyping robots , in addition to the ``URK'' (Utah Robot Kit) robot. In the Hybrid Systems Control Project, we are working to develop a graphical DES (Discrete Event System) hybrid controller, simulator, and analysis framework. Major CISE and CISE-related Projects: The Utah Robot Kit (URK) and the Utah Prototyping Environment (UPE). Concurrent Design and Manufacturing. Sensing for Advanced Manufacturing and Reverse Engineering. Discrete Event and Hybrid Systems in Robotics and Automation.",
