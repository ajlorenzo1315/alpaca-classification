Because it runs in the kernel, this extension code can access hardware and other operating systems services with with almost no overhead (basically a procedure call), and data can be passed by reference, rather than copied. All extension code (and most of the kernel) is written in the typesafe language Modula-3 . SPIN runs on DEC Alpha workstations. We're using it to write both specialized applications such as network video systems, as well as for supporting general purpose UNIX programs. You can connect to a machine running SPIN with the in-kernel SPIN web server here . For example, with SPIN running on a 133 MHz Alpha, an application can handle and recover from a page fault in 29 microseconds. Recent reports and papers Dynamic Binding for Extensible Operating Systems An invocation mechanism which provides flexible, efficient, and simple way of integrating extensions with an executing system. Appeared in the 2nd OSDI. Appeared in the 15th SOSP. Writing an Operating System Using Modula-3 Describes our experiences using Modula-3 to build a high performance extensible system. Language Support for Extensible Operating Systems We've been pretty happy with M3, but we've had to deal with a few shortcomings in order to use the language in a safe extensible operating system. Safe Dynamic Linking in an Extensible Operating System Describes the dynamic linker we use to load code into the kernel. Language and Runtime Support for Dynamic Interposition of System Code Describes the kernel's internal communication and extension facilities. Shows use of dynamic code generation to improve the performance of a critical kernel service. Project members Who we are. Benchmarks Interested in the bottom-line?
