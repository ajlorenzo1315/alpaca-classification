My research interests lie in the areas of network protocols, distributed computing, fault-tolerance, and in particular self-stabilizing systems. Implicit in the design of any system is a labeling of its states as \"legitimate\" or \"illegitimate\". A system is said to be self-stabilizing when regardless of its initial state, it is guaranteed to converge to a legitimate state in a finite number of steps. 25, No. 1, March 1993. ``Stabilization of Maximum Flow Trees''.
