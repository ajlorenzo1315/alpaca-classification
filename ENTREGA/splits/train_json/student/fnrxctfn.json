David Christianson dbc1@cs.washington.edu Computer Science & Engineering Department, University of Washington, Box 352350 Seattle, WA 98195 USA Current Work In my spare time I am a third year graduate student here at the UW . I'm currently studying Knowledge Representation, goal-directed behavior, mixed-initiative planning, activity recognition, and buzzword acquisition in the context of human-computer interaction. Some of my recent work has been to prototype useful/intelligent interfaces for Bob Doorenbos' ShopBot . One simple assistant we've built is a Mac application that automatically reads and parses shopping baskets in order to determine what products the user is interested in. I have also collaborated with Sean Anderson, Li-Wei He, Dan Weld, David Salesin, and Michael Cohen to develop a simple interactive movie that demonstrates automatic camera planning. The number of people whose lives it has touched grows each and every day. I spent my undergraduate career at the University of Chicago , carboloading at Harold's Chicken and assisting in the Animate Agent Lab . 1992 Symposium: Sensor Fusion V . Boston, MA, November 1992. I recently competed in the Senior Nationals . Sibling on the WWW My sister just graduated from the School of Information and Library Studies at the University of Michigan. Just Surfing...
