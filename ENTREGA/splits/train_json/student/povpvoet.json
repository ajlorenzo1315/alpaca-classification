I grew up in Istanbul, Turkey , received my B.S.E in Computer Science from Princeton University in 1993 and am currently working towards a Ph.D. on the SPIN project with Prof. Brian Bershad . I helped build a prototype 3-D display during the summer of '91 at the NEC Research Center in Princeton, New Jersey. Projects My goal is to develop safe, adaptable and extensible operating systems. I also wrote the machine specific aspects of the SPIN kernel, such as the system call and interrupt paths, and some miscellaneous interfaces, such as alarms and mach compatibility support. The novel aspects of SPIN threads and scheduling are that they provide the means of extending a kernel with arbitrary thread implementations and scheduling policies. Dynamically linking the extensions into the kernel allows us to achieve high-performance. The novel aspect of the SPIN protection domain interface is that it allows isolation and safe fine-grain sharing at the same time. Further, extensions can hide some of their code and data such that they can be assured that no one can possibly access them. The clincher is that extensions that want to share code and data can do so with no dynamic protection enforcement overhead. Papers Safe Dynamic Linking in an Extensible Operating System WCSSS 1996.
