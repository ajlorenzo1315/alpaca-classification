THIS HOMEPAGE IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION Originally I am from Vaihingen/Enz, Germany . In August 1995 after my graduation I moved to Las Cruces to start graduate school. After my graduation here I want to move back to Germany and start working or get into a doctoral program in computer architecture. While I was back in Germany this summer I visited the Computer Science department of the Friedrich Schiller Universitaet in Jena. This site is in German only. I really don't have a logical explanation for this, I just know that it has been a dream of mine since I was a little child. When I was four years old I told my mother that one day I would live in the US for a while. So, here I am. I really like cats a lot. I have two at home. The larger one of the two is called Dim Sum. He is the older one and has been with me for about three years. The smaller one - Sogo - is his best friend. She is about eighteen months old and the wild one of the two. Besides playing with my cats, I like reading a lot, I am an active member of Amnesty International and enjoy dancing or just hanging out with friends. This summer I was an intern at the German Cancer Research Institute in Heidelberg working as a C programmer at their teleradiology system called Medicus-2 .Check out their hompages!!
