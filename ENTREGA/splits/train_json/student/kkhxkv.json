Here is some stuff you'll find here Paper for STC Conference in Seattle Here is the paper that my fellow colleagues and I produced for our  presentation at the 43RD Annual Conference in Seattle . The conference is in May, and if you are going, be sure to check us out! Essential Information If you don't know me, this is sort of a personal biography. Even if you do know me, you may be shocked at what you find here. Projects Currently I am working as one of the honorary BGSU Web Webmasters . I also assisted in the redesign of the BGSU Web . As a BGSU Computer Science Graduate student, I am working with my colleague Dean Zeller on designing a Tennis Tournament monitoring application for USTA Tournaments. We are using Borland Delphi to create this application, and are currently in the process of developing the interface. To see information on some of the other projects I've done, see the Projects section of my online resume . You have to be pretty damned good to be a performance major these days. I'd have starved by now. When I get the time, I still enjoy playing though.
