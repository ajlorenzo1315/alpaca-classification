    "Cuerpo": "The guiding vision of this work is of a time, perhaps 50 years hence, in which materials science has taken the place of computer architecture, and computers are crystals, with each processor a molecule in the lattice. So far, my work could be characterized as a feasibility study: I have produced a 3-D cellular architecture which could be efficiently realized with current hardware, a simulator for this architecture, algorithms, programs, and an operating system design for general-purpose computing. I believe that this connection to the architecture has been a good thing for algorithm design, and to really exploit parallel machines we need a language for which the costs of operations are as easy to estimate as they are for C++ on a Von Neumann machine.
