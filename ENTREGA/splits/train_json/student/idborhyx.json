I went to grades K-2 in Solapur, India, to grades 2-3 in Enugu, Nigeria, to grades 4-8 in the Bronx, NY, and to high school in Charleston, West Virginia (Question:  What's West Virginia's state flower? Answer:  A satellite dish.) My M.Eng. project was \"A TOL Interpreter,\" implemented in LISP. TOL is a lambda-calculus-like language that supports pattern matching and object oriented programming. Then I joined the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center , IBM Research Division , IBM , Yorktown Heights, NY, where I was a Senior Associate Programmer for about two and a half years, working in architecture verification. We implemented an architecture-level test case generator for the S390 machine in C++ and published a couple of papers on our generator. Then, I joined the Computer Science Ph.D. program at Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences , New York University , New York, NY, where I am working in computer vision with Prof. Robert Hummel. In the 95-96 academic year, I implemented a parallel object recognition program on a SIMD machine with 64x72 processing units and (only) 192 bits RAM per processing unit, exploiting the SIMD machine's parallelism as much as possible. In summer 1995, I was a summer intern at Intel , Santa Clara, CA, in the Site Yield group. I implemented enhancements to a wafer map analysis and correlation tool used by Intel Pentium design engineers to improve yield in the chip manufacturing process. In summer 1996, I was a summer intern at Intel , Santa Clara, CA, in the Microcomputer Research Lab (MRL) group. The graph editor computes (if necessary), reads in, and displays a compiler's control and data flow graphs, allows arbitrary editing of these graphs, and plugs in the modified graphs back into the appropriate phase of the compiler. The graph editor is used for research experimentation with new compiler optimizations/heuristics and new architectures. In the 95-96 academic year, I worked with Prof. Robert Hummel in computer vision and object recognition on The FULCRUM Project . During the 96-97 academic year, I will be working with Prof. Robert Hummel again in computer vision, on the ND-Hash project (n-dimensional geometric hashing for object recognition). At the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center , IBM Research Division , IBM , Yorktown Heights, NY, I worked in architecture verification, and co-authored the following two papers with our group: \"Architectural Verification of Processors Using Symbolic Instruction Graphs,\" Proceedings of the 1994 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design. \"AVPGEN - A Test Case Generator for Architecture Verification,\" 1995 IEEE Transactions on VLSI Systems. -A famous comedian (but don't know who)",
