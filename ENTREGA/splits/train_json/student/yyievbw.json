Okay, maybe a little . Academics Current Research: For the past year I have been working with Brian Bershad . My primary responsibility is the construction of a UNIX server for the SPIN operating system. Safety and protection are maintained at the language level, as SPIN and its extensions are written in Modula-3 . SPIN dynamically linked extensions are used to intercept OSF/1 system calls and to emulate a Mach kernel environment. Previous Research: SPIN is not the first extensible system I have worked on. In my undergraduate studies at Notre Dame I helped implement user-level memory management for an extensible communications subsystem. Web Stuff I'm afraid I don't have the time to sit around and surf the Web, so I wouldn't claim to know about all the cool stuff out there. Meanwhile, these are some of the sites I visit occasionally for work and for distraction. University of Washington Computer Science and Engineering: the reason I'm in Seattle. GDB Debugging Manual: how I've solved countless problems. University of Notre Dame: my undergraduate institution. CSE Racquetball Ladder: my main outlet for athletics. ESPN Sportzone: how I stay in touch with the sports world. USA Today: how I stay in touch with the rest of the world. Dilbert: how I learn about the real world. Movies: Seattle regional movie listings. L. L. Bean: the only shopping Web page I will visit. David Dion Last modified:  Monday 1 April 1996",
