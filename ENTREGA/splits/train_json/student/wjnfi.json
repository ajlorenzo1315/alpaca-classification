I have been at Georgia Tech since 1988 when I started working on my B.S. After graduating in 1992 I started working on my Master's (1994) and now my PhD. Dissertation Work The title of my dissertation is tentatively: Network and System Support for the Efficient, Scalable Delivery of Interactive Multimedia Systems I may eventually put an HTML version of my proposal up, but if you are really interested in seeing a Table of Contents or more information, send me e-mail (kevin@cc.gatech.edu). For more information, see the Digital Video Project home page! My plan is to spend the next six months working on my current research projects, and the final three months writing and finalizing my dissertation. The three most significant projects I'm working on now are:  (1)  Development of the Interactive Multimedia Jukebox, (2) Video Delivery at Georgia Tech, and (3) Continued Work on the Mlisten collection tool.
