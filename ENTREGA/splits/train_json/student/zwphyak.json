Personal Information How to Reach Me Papers Doctoral Research: Interaction and Information Presentation in Augemented Reality My research is done within the context of the Computer Graphics Lab Research in Augmented Reality . Augmented reality is a form of virtual reality that uses see-through displays to enhance the world will computer generated material. More powerful, automated environment management techniques are required. We are building a testbed ( COTERIE ) for fast prototyping of distributed virtual environment systems that supports multiple simultaneous users interacting in environments with many heterogenous displays and input devices. The testbed is designed around a multi-threaded, modular, object oriented programming model and supports fully transparent distributed communications via both client-server and fully replicated distributed objects. By building applications as groups of cooperating threads, a single programming model can be used for both single and multiprocess programs. An important component of this testbed is a high-level, distribted graphics library. Finaly, we are building a number of applications using this testbed and environment management to both demonstrate their utility and point the way towards future research. Here are the slides from a the talk I gave at UIST'96. The 3D Hardware accelerator FAQ Part 1 and Part 2 (Last updated: Tue Mar 19 19:23:27 EST 1996) This is the FAQ I'm maintaining of 3D accelerators for PCs. For now, the FAQ is slanted in that direction, but that will change. MISC Some mirrors of the Info-Mac Archives My Netscape bookmarks Webmaker Docs A video camera in our lab. Check back in early July. Proselytization I'm using Modula-3 for my research right now, because I believe it's the best language that I have available on all the architectures I need to use. I'm also using Obliq, an interpretted language built on top of Modula-3. An Obliq computation may involve multiple threads of control within an address space, multiple address spaces on a machine, heterogeneous machines over a local network, and multiple networks over the Internet. The distributed computation mechanism is based on Modula-3 Network Objects. bm@cs.columbia.edu",
