Risk averse decisions If I were to bet you a quarter on the outcome of a coin toss, you would probably accept the bet. If I were to bet you $1000 on the same coin toss, you would probably reject the bet. Why do people reject fair bets? However, this does not explain why people, when asked the same question formulated in both a risk taking and a risk preventing manner, will respond differently. Here's an example from our beloved Tversky and Kahneman, taken almost verbatim from \"The Framing of Decisions and the Psychology of Choice\" (Science, 1981): Imagine that the US is preparing for the outbreak of an unusual disease which is expected to kill 600 people. Assume that the exact scientific estimate of the consequences of the programs are as follows: Problem 1: [N=152] If program A is adopted, 200 people will be saved. [72%] If program B is adopted, there is 1/3 probability that 600 people will be saved, and 2/3 probability that no people will be saved. [78%] Which one of the two programs would you favor? Accurate processing with inaccurate outcomes Sometimes we simply come up with the \"wrong\" answer. We make mistakes in subtraction while balancing our checkbook, or \"remember\" an invalid telephone number. But that's another story...) Nevertheless, we would be hard pressed to point to a misfiring of a neuron to account for this error. Can correct processing lead to incorrect results? (Is human cognitive processing 'sound' or even 'complete'?) (REMINDER: Make those quotes italicized.)
