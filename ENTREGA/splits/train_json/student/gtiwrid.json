Finton finton@cs.wisc.edu Computer Sciences Department University of Wisconsin-Madison 1210 West Dayton Street Madison, WI 53706 (608) 262-9275 Welcome to my page! I'm a grad student / research nerd in artificial intelligence here at the University of Wisconsin-Madison . I'm now a dissertator at this institution , after taking a little over a year to develop traffic measurements software for after my first thesis advisor left Wisconsin. When I'm not at my trusty NeXT station or the library, I enjoy playing trumpet and piano, listening to \" longhair music \", playing volleyball with the InterVarsity folks, and contributing to the SuperSoaker arms race. If you have any comments about my pages, feel free to use my comment form , or just send me e-mail . Or finger my account to see my current plan and whether I'm on the system. Making machines more intelligent is the goal of Artificial Intelligence. To me, the essence of intelligence is the ability to learn and adapt, to learn to act appropriately in order to reach our goals. Reinforcement learning treats this problem in the general case where the system has outputs to control actions that can change its environment, and it has inputs through which it senses its environment. It also has an input for reinforcement, which is a weak kind of feedback which can be expressed as a positive or negative number. (See my note on importance-based feature extraction ). Currently I am applying this notion of importance to the problem of learning to balance the need to explore the world with the need to perform optimally (exploration vs. exploitation). I hope that this will provide a basis for intelligent action which will also benefit from knowledge-based and task-based work. reinforcement learning page for more information. My Hotlist This is my browser-independent hotlist . It's actually my Bookmarks file from OmniWeb , which is a more elegant and more functional browser than Netscape , in my opinion.
