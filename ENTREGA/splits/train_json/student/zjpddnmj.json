Personal Mike is starting his 7th year as a graduate student at the University of Washington. Hopefully, with a little luck he will be finished around the end of the winter quarter. Mike got his start as a programmer in 1981 while fixing and maintaining computer hardware for the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory , which is part of the Smithsonian , but located within Harvard . Learning to debug software was the only way Mike could convince the programmers that the hardware really was working correctly. Mike stayed at the Smithsonian for 8 years, during which time he wrote a program called SAOimage which is used by lots of astronomers to look at images. (Mike would like to thank Bill Wyatt, Eric Mandel , Joe Schwarz, and Doug Mink for starting, guiding, and continuing the project, not to mention countless others who contributed). In 1986, Mike took a year off to work with a group of seismologists in Paris, France, doing data acquisition, calibration, and analysis. He had a truly wonderful time in Paris . Luz Angela had come to Paris that year from her native Colombia in South America. In the summer of 1994, Mike wrote a front end to let students browse the University's time schedule data base through UWIN. Special thanks to Bill Shirey, who did most of the design, and Tracy Stenvik, who wrote the UWIN screen library. (If you are on a UW machine, you can run UWIN here.) In between working on the time schedule Mike also taught beginning programming, through the UW Extension, to a very motivated group from Microsoft product support who sacrificed their summer to learn C. Recently Mike has presented papers at the International Symposium on Object Technologies for Advanced Software (ISOTAS'96) , ACM Conference on Object Oriented Programming Systems, Languages, and Applications (OOPSLA'96) , and the ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE'96) He also presented a poster at OOPSLA'95, made presentations at the Subjectivity Workshops at OOPSLA'94 and OOPSLA'96, participated in the Doctoral Symposium at OOPSLA'95, and participated in a demo at UIST'96 (thanks Steve). In an earlier life Mike earned BS and MCP degrees in architecture (the wooden kind) and city planning from MIT and worked as the Community Development Director for the city of Grinnell , Iowa . While the things he works on are different now, the skills in visual design and problem solving continue to be of value - and he still gets to talk about Chris Alexander . He also enjoys swimming at Lake Bronson. More recently, Mike's \"free\" time has been taken up by Marco Harold Sebastien Van Hilst, who was born on May 10, 1996. Mike will post pictures as soon as he locates another photo scanner. Michael VanHilst Last modified: Friday, November 8, 1996",
