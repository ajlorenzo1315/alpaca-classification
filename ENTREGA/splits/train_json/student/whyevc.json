I will graduate in May of 1997 with my Master's Degree in Computer Science and live happily ever after... I have been programming in C/C++ for over 3 years and have moonlighted in A.I. for the Artwork Project at NMSU's Computing Research Lab (CRL) . Most of my programming in C/C++ has been on the Windows 3.1/95/NT platforms, but I have also worked with the X11 and XView libraries in UNIX. In fact, the simulator I wrote for CS273 uses these libraries for the GUI. My primary career interests include 3D graphics (modeling and animation), texture mapping, and high-quality rendering. I am also interested in object-oriented design, GUI design, artificial intelligence, and software usability. Feel free to read my Resume . I will be more than happy to answer any questions you might have either by e-mail or by phone at (505)521-4487.

Other Web Pages I've Designed: CS Grad Student Homepage As the 1996-1997 President of NMSU's Computer Science Graduate Student Organization, I have assigned myself the task of redesigning the CS Grad Student web pages. I've already added links to on-line versions of the NMSU Grad Student Handbook, NMSU Grad Student Catalog, Important Dates for Grad Students, and am currently working on the CS Dept's Grad Student Handbook. On-line Users's Guide for NMSU's Motorola MCH6811 Simulator As an undergraduate CS student, I wrote a GUI-based simulator for the MCH6811 family of Motorola's microprocessors. Instead of just providing printed documentation for this simulator, I had planned to provide a fully linked HTML version of the manual. Due to time contraints (and this nagging attachment to sleep), I have only partially completed the \"HTML-ized\" version of the user's manual.
