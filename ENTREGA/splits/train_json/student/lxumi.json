When I am not listening to rock music or goofing off, I work on the Cornell ATM Cluster Project with my advisor Thorsten von Eicken . The other \"P\" I am in love with is Plum who is known to the great unwashed as Pelham Grenville Wodehouse. And yes, I also attended Woodstock '94! For the truly motivated, here is an online Woodstock review with photographs. Woodstock is where I experienced Metallica live for the first time! I would have loved to see the soccer worldcup last year, but unfortunately, it did not happen. I like to cook, and have tried to put some recipes that I like online. Links to some more cool stuff The Calvin and Hobbes Archive || South Asian Writers || Cheers || Monty Python || Beavis and Butthead Other Useful Stuff The CUINFO gopher And now for something completely different.. I am working on the Cornell ATM Cluster Project which aims at providing a high performance communications layer on clusters of workstations such that parallel program performance comparable to state of the art MPPs can be acheived on such clusters. We have developed a very fast message passing layer called U-Net and an implementation of Active Messages and Split-C on U-Net that show performance at par with parallel programs running on the CM-5 and the Meiko CS-2.
