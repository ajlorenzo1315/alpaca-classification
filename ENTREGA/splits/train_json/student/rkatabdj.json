Information & Computer Science, University of California, Irvine , 1996 Ph.D. Information & Computer Science, University of California, Irvine , in progress (1997 or 1998; see the Number One Lie Told by Graduate Students ) Research My research is on improving the performance of Large Scale Distributed Simulations through Interest Management, aka data subscription, data distribution management, or relevance filtering. I've recently completed a survey of previous work in the area. Almost all of the work in this area to date has been targeted at Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) systems. My work attempts to make dynamic Interest Management feasible using an autonomous objects paradigm. Employment When I'm not at UCI, I'm working to support my education habit, which unfortunately takes up more of my time than I'd like. You will notice that this is conveniently related to my research at UCI. M. Fukuda, K. Morse, L. Bic, M. Dillencourt, D. Menzel and E.

Important Stuff Support your right to free speech on the Internet. Fight back! I'm a member of UCI's Women in Computer Science (WICS) group. Fun Stuff Pictures! The Concuspidor and the Grand Wizard of Many Things Here's my pick for favorite web site. The department is giving me so much support. I turned down a lot of great job offers to come here. I'd be delighted to proofread your book/chapter/article. It doesn't bother me at all that my college roommate is making $80,000 a year on Wall Street.",
