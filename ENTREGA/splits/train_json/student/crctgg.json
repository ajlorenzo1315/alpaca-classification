Durand Computer Science Department Boston University 111 Cummington Street, MCS-211 Tel: (401) 781-5137 dgd@cs.bu.edu I'm a graduate student in Computer Science at Boston University, working on collaborative editing. I'm more interested in text and hypertext than multimedia and hypermedia, and I'm most interested in how people can collaborate by using and editing shared hypertexts. Fortunately for both sides of my professional personality, the same kind of technology is required to solve both problems. Real-time collaboration is something that I think is very important, but it's not one of my current areas of activity. I'm also an SGML (or at least content-markup) bigot. This page contains descriptions of my work on versioning and markup. The Palimpsest paper was presented at the Workshop on Collaborative Editing Systems at CSCW '94. It is the most up-to-date documentation of my most general work on version control. This converted version is complete except that it is still missing the first 2 illustrations. Fabio Vitali and I have written a paper proposing a system of version management for the World Wide Web. With Fabio Vitali and the others in the group, I've been working on a draft of functional requirements for versioning on the web. Markup Content markup is technique for describing texts for future processing. There are also interesting problems with handling non-hierarchical markup in SGML, as well as good arguments that non-hierarchical structures are important in texts I've been following up the work on non-hierarchical markup with Elli Mylonas and Steven DeRose in a paper abstract accepted at the 1996 ACH/ALLC annual conference in Bergen. The Text Encoding Initiative has a variety of lessons to offer to the HTML effort. In a paper to appear at the Fourth WWW conference, four fellow TEI alumni and I offer some Lessons for the World Wide Web from the Text Encoding Initiative. Versioning Working Group The Versioning Working Group is a group of (currently four) people who are all concerned with the problems of version management in hypertext systems. Currently, we are working on a paper (a sort of union framework of the strategies for version and change management of which we are aware). We held a workshop at ECHT '94, which we hope will help to expand and solidify the \"hypertext version management community.\" HyTime ongoing review Steven DeRose and I have also prepared some input to the ongoing HyTime review process -- A technical Corrigendum has been accepted at ballot, but The final wording of the upcoming changes has not yet been determined. Most changes proposed in this document have been accepted in principle (i.e. some things have been changed, but in a different way from what we suggested).",
