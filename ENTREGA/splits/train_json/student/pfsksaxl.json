I'm currently on academic leave from UW and working as a research scientist at Bellcore in Morristown, NJ. Research work At Bellcore: I'm interested in distributed computing issues - distributed OO systems, application/system development, high availability. I currently work with the distributed systems group in Bellcore on high availability in distributed software systems. Our group is developing a toolset, Anatidae , that provides high availability mechanisms for distributed applications that adhere to the CORBA standard. We have also looked at active replication schemes for high availability in DCE applications. I'm also interested in high availability issues for the Web and integration of distributed OO technology with Web servers. Details on safety research at UW can be found at the UW safety page . As an undergraduate, I attended Angelo State University (San Angelo, TX), and then, Wesleyan University (Middletown, CT), where I received a B.A. Right after, I came to the University of Washington in Seattle to puruse graduate studies in Computer Science. I like to play tennis whenever I can. Squash, and to a lesser extent racquetball, suffice when I can't. I've been participating in Ultra Cricket , a play-by-email cricket simulation game, for many years. The NY/NJ area has some of the best places for learning and dancing. At UW, I was involved with the Model United Nations (MUN) chapter. Conferences are held throughout the year on current topics - restructuring and reforming parts of the UN like the Security Council, ECOSOC, the IMF and the World Bank, rapid population growth, nuclear proliferation, etc. Here is the home page for the MUN chapter of UW. My other interests are in reading the poetry of Mirza Ghalib, a 19th century Indian poet. I'm also interested in English literature, especially the Romantic and Victorian periods. Web links Here is the obligatory collection of Web sites that I tend to visit often.",
