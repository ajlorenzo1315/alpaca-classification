    "Cuerpo": "- E.De Amicis My background In 1994 and after a lot of traveling I finally got my degree in Computing Systems Engineering (English link) at Universidad de los Andes in Santafe de Bogota - Colombia (South America). As a member of the DFAC (Computer Aided Manufacturing and Design) Research Group at Universidad de los Andes I Worked for a year as Research Assistant developing a software library for Image Processing and Computer Vision. I discovered this photograph last year in a box in the attic of my father's house. Other activities In 1993 I volunteered as a Park Ranger in the Katios National Park for two months. The park is located in an area known as the Darien Gap (since it is very dense tropical rainforest) in Colombia near the Panama border. If you share this interest and are in the NY area e-mail me! My work is in Content Based Visual Query (using Computer Vision/Image Processing techniques for searching and indexing image and video databases based on the content of the images in conjunction with textual descriptions). Previous work In the Robotics Group I worked on the Virtual Vision Lab project. In the Graphics Group, last year I did some work on an Stk interface for n-Vision (3D utility for viewing multi-variate data). I have not done much photography lately but I do every time I get a chance. I do mostly travel photography in slide and black and white film. It's obvious there are lots of problems, and everybody mostly knows Colombia for it's coffee and... but it's much more than that.

Now, if you'd like to know more about Colombia than what you see in the news or movies (all of the movies I have seen which mention Colombia were filmed somewhere in Mexico right accross the border- not to mention t.v.

Lonely Planet: Here you'll find some nice photographs and a travel guide (I've used it- it's outstanding and there's a new edition.). It's also a short introduction (no photographs, of course).
