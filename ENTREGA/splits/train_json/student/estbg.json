    "Cuerpo": "This place is in Andhra Pradesh (for people interested in geography) a southern state in India . After schooling, I joined Osmania University , College of Technology for my Bachelor's in Chemical Engineering. Made a lot of friends. We were always proud to call ourselves THE BATCH OF 1990-94 . Then in 1994 came over to USA to University of Nebraska-Lincoln . Had a great gala time there. It was there that I became addicted to American football. Studied there for one year in Computer Science before I transferred over to University of Texas-Austin. Here in Austin also I have made a lot of friends (as usual) . Here are some of the fun loving and acad caring people (I listed this out in alphabetical order. So no ........) Abraham Gokul Kumar Mehul Neeraj Shantanu Shailesh Vipin As I like it ... One of the things I like the best is to keep on chatting to friends (I know many of u out there know it ! I also like making new friends , travelling around. I play games like Chess (any questions), Carrom Board, Racquet Ball, Tennis, Table Tennis , Cricket, Soccer .... and on and on. I love watching NBA games . Want to check my horoscope for today . Well there is a lot more to write but I would not like to bore you and also narrow down my options of some one liking me!! So what ever success I have in my life will of course be attributed to my \"Hardwork\", \"Wil power\" and  all good things. If some thing bad happens we can always say \"Man Proposes and God Disposes....\". Hide out.. 2910 Medical Arts St,#205 Austin TX-78705 +1 512- 469- 6050 gooty@cs.utexas.edu Have Fun Fingering me!!
