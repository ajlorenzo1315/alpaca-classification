    "Cuerpo": "This is my homepage. And that's a fact! That's the undegraduate physics page, in case you didn't come from there. I used to be in physics, so i get to be linked from thence. If not...well, i can't do much about that! It really wasn't my idea to get one: it was made for me against my will. Fortunately, though, i have elected to stay far away from physics for the time being, and continue my education in CS (Computer Science, i just don't like typing it all out). What that means is that i get to share an office, get to use the graduate lounge, but have to take undergrad classes to make up for the fact that i didn't take any when i was an undergrad. Although it's about the US and i live in Canada, the US is so powerful that it's policies somehow affect policies in Canada. Even if you are a staunch conservative, i suggest you check out the site. First, i think it is always good to hear another person's point of view, even if you disagree with it. And even if you still disagree after you have heard the other side of the story, maybe at least you will gain understanding. I think no one will ever know, either. Where are the evolutionists? In my opinion, this is getting a little unhealthy here... Now, the question is, are most people creationists or are most people evolutionists (but are a silent majority who feel extremely secure about their point of view)? Or are the creationists just a very vocal group who are trying to sway people to their side? Either way, the lack of several points of view is unhealthy (how can you get understanding without discussion?) Something similar happened about a year ago where some guy almost got sued by Disney for having their pictures on his homepage, but i can't seem to find him anymore. Here's my menial contribution to the party.",
