    "Cuerpo": "That doesn't mean that they're going to look at all fancy--expect very little. But at least they'll be a little more current. Work stuff: The University of Texas at Austin CS department . I've finished one year, and I'm trying not to think of how many more I have to go. Amherst College , a great place to spend your undergraduate days. While there, most of my time was spent (not unpredictably) with the Amherst College CS department . The Santa Fe Institute . Texas Squash home page The Mead home page. Try this stuff. You wanted more people to check your page, Ted? Dan Sharp . An amazing home page, and a guy with too much free time. If you're in Austin, check out the Austin Dining Guide . Actually this page has more than just that information about Austin, but I think that's the most important part. Citizen Poke. Alas, I'm no longer so sure that they have a very bright future. A new type of machine, the BeBox, looks like it could be neat. It's a simple page, but it'll do. If you want to send me email, this page is maintained by me: sfkaplan@cs.utexas.edu . But before you do that, you might want to grab my PGP key , which includes some links to information on PGP and encryption in general.",
