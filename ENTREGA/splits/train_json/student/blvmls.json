I have begun my job search and am interested in a position in the software industry: Seeking a company with which I can apply technical expertise, management knowledge, and leadership skills in an innovative technology and product development environment driven by identified or expected customer needs. Dean has passed his qualifying exams, and has proposed a thesis topic: Visualizing Patterns of Interaction in the Execution of Object-Oriented Programs The dynamic behavior of object-oriented programs is difficult to design, implement, and modify. This thesis work seeks to identify, visualize, and analyze recurring patterns of interaction in object-oriented program executions as a means for understanding and examining dynamic behavior. Research Interests Dean is a member of the software visualization research group. His other interests include information visualization, object-oriented software engineering, user-interface design, and human computer interaction. Visualizing Object-Oriented Software The object-oriented approach to program design has made a significant impact on the way software is developed and maintained. Of course, these interactions are the most difficult part of the system to design and understand. My approach is to use visualization to convey information to programmers about their systems that is not available through static analysis and dynamic profiling. The key to my approach is the use of patterns of interaction between entities in the system as abstractions which bridge the gulf of abstraction between a program's design and its implementation. Graphical visualizations are used to present this information to programmers, and allow them to control the filtering and abstraction process. A technical report is available describing this framework, \"Using Visualization to Foster Object-Oriented Program Understanding\" . Pertinent references include: Jerding, Dean F., John T.

Navigational techniques which utilize some representation of the entire information space provide context to support more detailed information views. Information murals can be used as stand-alone visualizations or in global navigational views. This technique evolved from research in visualizing the execution of large object-oriented programs (see above).
