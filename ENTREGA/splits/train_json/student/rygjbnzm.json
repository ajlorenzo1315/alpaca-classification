I am a recent transplant to San Diego from Raleigh , North Carolina , where I got my M.S. send money to Harvey Gantt . My current research interest is connectionist vision and face recognition. I am working with Gary Cottrell , so I am a member of Gary and Eric's Unbelievable Research Unit (GEURU) . I'm not in the group picture (waahh) but I am a Geuron . If for some crazy reason you want to know where I am right now, my schedule may help. A few things I like Surfing (under construction!). Veganism . You should too! Why? Coffee Shops . Maybe I'll start my own SD coffee shop page. In my spare time, that is. Live Music . Chiles! Back to the computer science home page mdailey@cs.ucsd.edu",
