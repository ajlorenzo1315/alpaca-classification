Wolff . I chose to be among those that will demonstrate that the JHU Computer Vision Lab is good in all the topics in which it does research. My personal research evolves around the exploitation of photometric invariants in stereo, \"3-D Stereo Using Photometric Ratios,\" Tech-Report 1993.10 and in object recognition \"A Curvature Based Invariant for Object Recognition Derived from Covariance of Photometric Values,\" Tech-Report 1995.12. Dog   : Phrini (after high demand I created a home page for her) Computer Poetry Chocolate on WWW My philosophy on Chocolate (spoken by Counselor Troi) My Favorite Websites: Cadbury's, THE Chocolate, THE Taste The official Moon Pie page The M&M Studio Publications : Well, since I am a doctorate candidate, I guess I have to show that I have published something.
