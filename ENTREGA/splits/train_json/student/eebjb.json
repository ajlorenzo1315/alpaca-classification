    "Cuerpo": "I'm Bill Murdock. Since fall of 1994 I have been studiying AI (part of an interdisciplinary Cognitive Science program) at the College of Computing , Georgia Institute of Technology . I received my master's degree in the spring of 1996 from Georgia Institute of Technology . In particular I have been working on a project called SIRRINE which uses models of this sort for self-redesign in the context of multi-agent environments such as meeting scheduling. The overall paradigm that SIRRINE operates under describes learning as a kind of design task; a reasoner is viewed as an abstract device and the learning process involves redesign of the device. In particular I have been working on the Design Case Study Framework, a long term research project with the objective of providing a large scale database of human readable artifact design cases for the support of engineering design. I have also worked as a Graduate Research Assistant on the HIPED project which involves intelligent integration of heterogeneous data sources in the context of design of physical devices and is part of the Intelligent Integration of Information Technology project within the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency . In this project, my work centers around Interactive Kritik, an AI design system which currently acts as the intelligent agent at the core of the HIPED system.
