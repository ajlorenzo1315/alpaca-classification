This page is, well, mostly destroyed. Gone. So-long, good-bye. Toasty. This is a picture of Dave: Pretty lousy, eh? Well, the guy sort-of pictured here is called Dave Bullas. A somewhat unassuming sort of fellow who used to be known in other circles as Warlord or Windraven. Dave has recently started a Masters degree here at the University of Alberta. So far, so good. He is also TAing Computing 601, which is a grad course designed to integrate new TAs into the U of A Comp Sci experience and prepare them for their TAing duties. Along with this job comes Dave's new official title: TA Training Co-Ordinator, which is really just a fancier way of saying the same thing: grunt. If this is your desired method of contact, check for me at the Limiting Interchange near Algor IV. IRC: Hah! If you are really bored, check for me at FICS, the Free Internet Chess Server (164.58.253.10 or dns.onenet.net). My handle there is Windraven. If its between noon and 1:00PM during the week, I'm likely in Bob Beck's office with the NHL. GSB 207 - check for me there. And, occasionally, you'll find me in the basement of SUB near the UAPGC or UACC offices. Well, I compromised and moved it here .",
