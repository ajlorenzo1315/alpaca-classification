    "Cuerpo": "Anyhow, here are some losers who I don't actually know, and who I would not really want to be associated with, but well, check it out. Maybe. I am a bad boy . I am a PhD student in The University of New Mexico Computer Science Department and I also work at The Santa Fe Institute . My PhD advisors are Stephanie Forrest , Alan Perelson , Dave Ackley , Jim Hollan and Carla Wofsy . Other Interests I enjoy photography. I get race practice and qual times from Gale Force , testing times and news snippets from Atlas and newspaper reports from The Electronic Telegraph I also enjoy reading the British magazine Autosport. I'm pretty keen on human rights too. I am a full supporter of the ACLU . It was a delightful revelation to me when I learnt that Liberty and Democracy, phrases which to me were synonyms at one time, are the opposite of each other. Liberty being the right of the minority to do what it wishes, and Democracy the right of the majority to decide for everyone. His punishment was to take huge doses of estrogen. He grew breasts. And it is probably why he comitted suicide. Other Lives For ten years I worked at Texas Instruments, mostly in corporate research. I met some great folk and worked on fun stuff. TI was a really good place to work for me, I learnt a ton, and feel I gave a ton too. Around 1991 I saw the movie Terminator 2 , and was struck with horror when the neural net hacker cracked consciousness and his invention was immediately snarfed by the military. I was thinking about consciousness at the time and I identified with this dude. (It used to be that one's Erdös number was important, but one has to have a low Arnie-number too.)",
