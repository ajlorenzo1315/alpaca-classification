And everything there is made of light. By indicating what a piece of information is, rather than how it should look, I have made the information in these pages more accessible to people who don't use bitmapped displays, including the blind. If you are offended, it's probably because you're stupid. I have just started my third year as a graduate student in the Computer Sciences Department . If by some miracle I pass my prelim, my research will add up to a hill of beans or, more likely, fizzle out before any results are obtained. To my surprise, about a year ago I discovered I was gay. This was especially surprising because I wasn't that convinced I was alive. Those who know me well would probably argue that my being gay is no proof of my being alive. Anyway, you might want to read my thoughts on being a hedgehog . I am not reliably at any specific location and often work from home. If you would like to see me in person, write me and we can set something up. If it becomes clear you'll want to contact me on short notice, I'll give you my pager number. Various creations: Thoughts on being a hedgehog My todo list (updated sporadically) A list of some associates My résumé (in PostScript) My Web documentation (the HTML section is long out of date, unfortunately) The DANEnet/DILHR JobNet Database (soon to be defunct) The Caltech Projects: The Caltech Institute Archives PhotoNet Database The Caltech Personnel Directory (this looks much better from inside Caltech) The Caltech WWW Database (inside Caltech anyone can enter their own pages into the database using a Forms interface) Some slides: Slides from a talk I gave on the Web Slides from a talk I gave on distributed objects Slides from a talk I gave called ``Java and the Dangers of Love'' Coming when hell freezes over, at this rate: I'll add more information to this page and break it up into a hierarchy I do some consulting. This index will allow me to assign a unique serial number to all the references I quote (such as the one at the top of this page) and provide the quote, source, contextual information, and pointers to other relevant quotes in the index. When the lab buys Adobe Distiller, I'll translate my résumé into PDF so more than 0.1% of the world's WWW users will have a chance of reading it (I suppose more than that can print it in a pinch). I want to do some writing about using computers. I think it's possible to do so, and it would make starting to use computers easier. Cheap shots at things I hate. It's a tough world out there.",
