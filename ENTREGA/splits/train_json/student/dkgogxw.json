Hong is a graduate student at the University of California, Irvine where he is pursuing his Ph.D. in computer science. His research interests are in the architecture and performance analysis of data traffic over ATM networks. He has published a number of papers on connectionless servers for ATM and ATM congestion control. E DUCATION Currently pursuing Ph.D. in Information and Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine . The first stage, design of a connectionless server for transmitting connectionless datagrams over the connection oriented Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network and performance analysis through simulations and analysis, is nearly complete having resulted in a paper currently in submission. More detail on my work experience at NCR/AT&T is available. Duke P. Hong and Tatsuya Suda, \" An investigation of connectionless servers for data transport over ATM ,\" in preparation.
