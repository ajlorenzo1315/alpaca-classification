    "Cuerpo": "I have been a student of the Athens University of Economics and Business (Athens, Greece) from October 1989 until June 1993, in the Department of Informatics , from where I received my Diploma in Informatics (Computer Science). Since October 1994, I am a graduate student and researcher in the University of California, San Diego , in the Computer Science and Engineering Department . I got a M.S. Among other things, I have been employed as a translator of computer related books during 1992, as an instructor in computer training seminars during the second half of 1993, and as a teaching assistant during the second half of 1994 and most of 1995. For more details, you should look at my research page , which is located in the web server of my research home, the Computer Systems Laboratory , where I am the systems and networks administrator since January 1996. As an alternative, you can directly jump to a (partial) list of my publications that are available on line. Teaching - Fall 1996 Information on the TCP/IP project and the IP and TCP classes for CSE123A. CSE123A Main Page. Out-of-band interests The Monty Python comedy troupe (silliness as an art form), from Bonni Hall. Contains links to just about everything on the Web about Flying Circus, the movies, the books, the fan-clubs. Also, links to information on British Comedy from cathouse.org: practically every British comedy show you may have ever come across is there. TeX and LaTeX: Everything you need is on the CTAN archives. My favorites are the extensions for multilingual support on the PC based versions. Here is the link to the United States site of CTAN (Comprehensive TeX Archives Network). Look under systems for TeX versions for various platforms and under language for multilingual support. I suggest using EmTeX for the PC and GreekTeX for Greek language support on the PC and elsewhere. For general information click here , or click here for information on the Hellenic Discussion List, news from Greece on the net and some great pictures. This time, it is an article in \"TA NEA\" which brings forward...the Greek presence in cyberspace! There are also Greeklish versions of the article and my comments .
