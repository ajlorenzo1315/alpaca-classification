Try our experiment over the web! Start by clicking on the frog at left. The algorithm involved stochastically optimizing this classification using the Swendsen-Wang algorithm (originally developed for simulations in statistical mechanics.) This is a paper describing my project. Another project involving volume rendering: I wrote a simple volume renderer as a Computer Graphics final project. Click on them for the animations. (Thanks to Professor David Dobkin for letting me use Princeton's RealityEngine to make these.) The CT data are classified into three materials: bone (white), fat (greenish), and soft tissue (orange). In the second, first soft tissue, and then fat are rendered gradually more transparent, leaving only bone. See ``Volume Rendering'', by Drebin, et al in SIGGRAPH '88 for more details of the rendering algorithm. I wrote a program called lafite for exploring the symmetries of 2-dimensional hyperbolic isometry groups. It has a limited interactive WWW front-end which you can try by clicking on the picture at left. This paper (500K, compressed PS) contains some background about lafite and the mathematics behind it. (Apologies for the out-of-date documentation.) I also wrote some code for the environmental artist Agnes Denes. Her current project `` Tree Mountain '' involves planting 10,000 trees on a sculpted man-made mountain in the Pinsio gravel pits, Ylojarvi, Finland. This picture shows a version of the pattern with only about 1,700 trees. This project was work with Professor John Conway and Tim Hsu at the Princeton mathematics department . aabd@das.harvard.edu , Harvard University , Division of Applied Sciences .",
