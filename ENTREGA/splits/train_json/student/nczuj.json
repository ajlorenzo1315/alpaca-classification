Novack and A. Nicolau Leisure Activities: Despite what my advisor may tell you, ;-) I don't actually have much free time, but I have been known to Dance Israeli folk dances (Favorite dance:  Shorashim) I don't go regularly any longer, but if you are interested in giving it a try, let me know. I still enjoy going from time to time. [I can get you $10 off... ;-)] Hurtle down mountainsides:  Skiing is a recent hobby for me. Read:  My favorite authors are Toni Morrison (especially her books \"Song of Soloman\" and \"Beloved\") and Don DeLillo (especially \"The Names\" and \"Ratner's Star\"). Dabble in foreign languages:  Right now, I just try to re-acquire whatever limited foreign language abilities I ever had. Languages that I forget more and more of on a daily basis are Hebrew (I can still speak, read, and write, but not very well), Spanish (can't speak or write, but for some strange reason I can understand a lot), and Japanese (I just nod knowingly).
