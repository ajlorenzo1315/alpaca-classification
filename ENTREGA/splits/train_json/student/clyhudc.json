    "Cuerpo": "My particular emphasis is on global software engineering environments , using the Web as a medium for international collaboration. I set up the original ICS Department's WWW server in 1993, created several WWW software packages , and then became involved in the effort to specify and improve the WWW infrastructure (the set of protocols that you used to retrieve and view this document) through the IETF working groups on URI , HTML , and HTTP . I am also one of the founding members of the Apache Group , creators of the Apache HTTP server that currently dominates the general-purpose server market. During the summer of 1995, I was a Visiting Scholar at MIT/LCS, working with Tim Berners-Lee and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) .

MOMspider A web robot for providing multi-owner maintenance of distributed hypertext infostructures. Life Story What, you're still reading this? My background is a bit odd: I was conceived in New Zealand and born in South Laguna , California . Although most of my schooling has been in the U.S., I was taught how to read during a year in Auckland . My father is an emeritus professor in Social Sciences here at UC Irvine, which is why I have been raised a Yank. I am part Maori , Kiwi , Yank, Irish, Scottish, British, and California beach bum. I also like playing basketball, softball, football and going fishing. Mind you, I haven't had time to do any of these things since I started messing with the Web. It is the flash of a firefly in the night. It is the breath of a buffalo in the wintertime. It is the little shadow which runs across the grass and loses itself in the sunset. --- Crowfoot's last words (1890), Blackfoot warrior and orator. To most readers it will be easy, after reading this tale, to accept Rover's theory that Man is set up deliberately as the antithesis of everything the Dogs stand for, a sort of mythical straw-man, a sociological fable. --- Clifford D. Simak, \"City\" [Notes on the Fifth Tale], 1952.",
