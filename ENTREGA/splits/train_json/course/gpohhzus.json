Since CS 431 is a prerequisite to this course, a basic knowledge and understanding of compilers is assumed. This course will take a more in-depth look at compiler topics such as various parsing techniques and grammars, code optimization, error recovery, and type checking. Grading Final grades will be determined from the following: Midterm Exam:\t30% Final Exam:\t35% Programs:\t30% Papers:\t\t 5% Programs All programs for this course will be written in either C or C++. They will be fairly time consuming and involved, so it is strongly recommended that you begin early on them. You will pass off your assignments by running them on input that I give you and turning in the results. If you begin early on the assignments and budget your time wisely, you will have enough time to complete the assignments. Since late homework is such a hassle to deal with, you will be penalized substantially for turning you work in late. For those of you familiar with LEX, you will essentially be writing a LEX equivalent. The second assignment will be to write a parser generator (like YACC). Papers You will write two papers this semester. The first will be due Feb. 9, and the second will be due March 30. The purpose of the papers is to familiarize you with current work being done in this field. The best way of accomplishing this is to have you research into the current literature and become familiar with journals, conferences and people in this area. Course Notes The course notes are available in the reserve section of the library. Exams There will be one mid-term exam during the semester on March 2. Tentative Course Outline There is a tentative course outline available. CS.531 News Group There is a news group for this class where students can have discussions.
