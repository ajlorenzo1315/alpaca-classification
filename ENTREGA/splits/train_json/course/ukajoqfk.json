    "Cuerpo": "If I find that it is a problem for a significant number of you I plan on complaining to NTU. I'm not sure if it will do any good, but its worth a try. If you have any other comments on the way the course is being taught please feel free to let me know (it will not affect your grade). OVERVIEW As software systems increase in size and complexity the difficulty of assuring that they function as intended increases rapidly. In this course we will examine different verification and validation approaches that are capable of providing us with evidence of software quality. LECTURES Durland 164 MW 3:30-4:45 pm Exams held in Nichols 236 INSTRUCTOR Prof. Matt Dwyer PREREQUISITES CIS 740 REQUIREMENTS The course will consist of lectures, readings, homework assignments and examinations. The bulk of the concepts in the course will be presented, explained and illustrated by way of extended examples in the lectures. Homework is designed to develop student's abilities to apply concepts and synthesize solutions to new problems based on those concepts. Lectures and Readings Lectures and readings function as an integrated presentation of the course material. Homework There will be four homework assignments. The assignments will involve applying and extending the concepts presented in the lectures and readings. For some of the homeworks you will be required to apply specific techniques to actual code. References If you do not have access to these papers, they have been collected and are available from Copy Co., phone number (913) 537-2679. In addition to the required readings you may find the following texts useful as they contain some of the material in the course. There are a number of general software engineering text. This text does a good job with software quaility issues: Fundamentals of software engineering , C. Ghezzi, M. Jazayeri and D. Mandrioli, Prentice-Hall The following two texts cover a broad range of testing techniques and contain significant practical information for testers. How validation and verification activities relate to other software development activities. We present and discuss a variety of models that are used to represent and reason about the possible behavior of a program. Validation and verification efforts are based on observing the behaviour of the software as it executes. Well look at techniques based on both of these: assertion based analyses involve periodic checking of intended behavior during program execution.",
