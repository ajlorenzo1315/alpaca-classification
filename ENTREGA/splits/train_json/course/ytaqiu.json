Your core activity will be to implement a variety of object-oriented language mechanisms using Scheme. We will develop a core language implementation, and the programming assignments will typically involve extending this core in various ways. This should give you a chance to spend less time coding and more time thinking. We will spend a significant part of our lecture time discussing the assignments and presenting solutions. The problems tend to be open-ended, and we learn a lot from seeing how others approach a problem. These are not formal presentations, and you should come to every class prepared to present your current work. Around the middle of the term, you will also be asked to pick a topic for a short paper. The paper will address one of the topics raised in the course, and should involve a literature survey as well as some original thought. How to setup Chez Scheme in your environment. How to setup emacs to run Scheme. Computer Science Department jrossie@csc.ncsu.edu Last modified: Mon Sep 2 23:21:47",
