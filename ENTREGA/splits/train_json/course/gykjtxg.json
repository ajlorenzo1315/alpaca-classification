    "Cuerpo": "As a rough guide, I suggest that your total effort in this course might be distributed as follows: preparation and follow-up for the course lectures: 50%; preparation and presentation of each lecture topic or paper: 25%. I will allocate lecture topics based on the needs of the course and the desires of the participants. I will attempt to have the lecture schedule firmed up by the third class period. Each lecturer will develop and present the topic and will make available a list of sources and other appropriate materials to allow the members of the class to prepare for and participate in the lectures. For each paper you write, you will propose a topic, and should secure my approval before you commence serious work. Use the newsgroup to keep tabs on class business and to contribute useful information for the other participants in the class. You are expected to be present and to participate in all the class meetings. If you lecture: your skill at preparing, organizing, and presenting your material. I will assign a grade to each paper; the grade will reflect my judgment of writing skills, technical content, and appropriateness of topic. In sum, the success of a seminar course such as this depends on the active involvement of the participants, and the quality of your participation will be a criterion in the grading. Reference sources for data communications and networks The Swain Library has some books and journals of interest for C623. Pick several important subtopics (with the instructor's help, if appropriate), and develop them in reasonable detail. If you are using sources other than the textbook, hand out a list of sources at least one week in advance of your lecture, so that others may have a chance to prepare for your lectures. Assign one or two homework exercises related to your topic. You will grade the homework for your lecture. The pace of a lecture is considerably faster with overheads than with the chalkboard, and you must allow your audience time to absorb the material, take notes, and develop questions. You will give a much better lecture if you deal with your present (presumably important) topic properly than if you rush to present a quickie sketch of the remaining material. If you find yourself out of material with 30 minutes remaining in the class, you will be embarrassed and the class will be irritated. If you need help in judging how much material is appropriate, I'll be glad to discuss it with you. You are not expected to be an expert in your topic, but you should be sufficiently prepared to lead the discussion.",
