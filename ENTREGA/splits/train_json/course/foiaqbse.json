    "Cuerpo": "Instead, students are expected to have prior experience programming with functions, arrays, and (ideally) records/structs as might be learned in a course using Pascal or C. Students who do well on the Advanced Placement Computer Science A exam (4/5) or who earn a 3 on the AB exam, should elect this course. Texts A Computer Science Tapestry: Exploring Programming and Computer Science with C++ by Owen Astrachan (McGraw-Hill) Algorithms, Data Structures and Problems Solving with C++ by Mark Weiss (Addison-Wesley) (optional) Introduction to the Public Clusters at Duke available at Gothic Bookshop (optional) C++, How to Program Deitel and Deitel Computing All programs should compile and execute on acpub Sun workstations. Collaboration You may (and should) work with someone else on programs. You may not collaborate on written assignments or quizzes. For each assigment you are expected to include a list of consultants and collaborators as part of the README that must be submitted. In order to earn an A+ you must do several of the optional assignments. There will be several optional assignments. Completion of these can earn points towards raising a grade by a half-step, e.g., from C+ to B-. Completion of some of the optional assignments is mandatory in order to earn an A+. The tests will be closed-book, the final exam will be open book. Random quizzes will be given out in class and then flipped-for at the beginning of the next class. Assignments turned in on the early due date will earn a 10% bonus (based on the total value of the assignment). No assignment will be accepted more than one week after the final due date. Information about changes in assignments, due dates, and hints/help will be posted there. News is the preferred forum for asking/answering questions. This page is accessible from the Duke Course page and from Prof. Astrachan's homepage. If you have such a partner, your writeup and final program should still be your own, except for the final project(s)  when a group can submit one program. You must work on your own on written assignments an on minor programming assignments.
