    "Cuerpo": "Overview This course provides an introduction to the foundations of programming languages, allowing a thorough understanding of programming language semantics and critical implementation characteristics. Scheme is used as a meta-programming language throughout the course, but this course is about fundamentals that are the basis for most programming languages, not just Scheme. Topics include Induction, Recursion, and Scope Direct semantics interpreters Continuation-passing style Continuation-semantics interpreter Imperative form and stack architecture Static and dynamic semantics for object-oriented programming Object-oriented run-time architecture Materials Required Essentials of Programming Languages , by Friedman, Wand and Haynes. This should also be available in the bookstores, and a couple copies are on reserve in the Swain Hall library. These materials will be announced in class and will be made available through the White Rabbit on Indiana (near Kirkwood) and will cost a few dollars to cover copying costs. You are not expected to understand the material on first reading, but having read it once first you will be much better prepared for class and discussion sections. Imperative programming: Chapter 4 sections 5 and 6. Week of October 14 CPS rules : EOPL chapter 8 sections 4, 7, and 8. Week of October 21 Representation-independent interpreter, continuations as records, and reified continuations : EOPL sections 9.1 through 9.3. Week of November 11 Second exam. Week of November 18 Java programming tutorial. Week of December 2 More object-oriented programming, Java style: EOPL section 7.2 for general information. Your answers to these questions, and your progress on the problems given in discussion section, will count toward your final grade. This will give you practice at indentation by hand (which is necessary for exams) and, more importantly, it is in most cases much easier to find mistakes in this course's exercises by thinking about them than by debugging. Scheme Quiz -- R September 19, in class; 10 percent. answers Exam One -- R October 17, in class, on EOPL chapters 1 through 5; 20 percent. Exam Two -- R November 14, in class, on material covered in class through T November 5 (does not include chapter 6: parameter passing); 20 percent. Final Exam -- T December 17, 5P-7P, LH102; 35 percent. Assignments; 10 percent.
