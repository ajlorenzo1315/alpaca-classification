Course Philosophy The goal of this course is not so much the content as learning how to learn new systems in graphical user interfaces. It will be up to the student (with some help from the TA) to find out the details necessary to complete the programming assignments. Because of this goal of teaching how to learn, there will not be as much lecture as in most CS classes. For each class period there will be reading assignments and problems which must be completed before class. Most of the class period will consist of presentation and discussion from students chosen randomly from the class. Grading Exams 40% 2 Tests 10% each Final exam 20% (half of this exam will cover the last third of the course and half will be comprehensive) Programs 40% (there will be 5 large programs, each reuses pieces from previous programs) Class Participation 20% Students will be regularly asked to present or discuss reading materials in class. Grading will be on whether or not you have prepared and thought carefully about the material. Missunderstandings of the material can be corrected by class discussions and will not be counted against you. Friday classes will be offered at the same time, at a place to be announced.
