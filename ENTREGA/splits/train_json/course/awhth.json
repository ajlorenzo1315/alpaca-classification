Operating Systems --- Fall'96--- A. Heddaya Home Page [ As of 1996.09.08 ] || Syllabus || Participants || Class meetings: A1   M 11:00am--1:00pm\tMCS-135 Instructor: A. Heddaya (Office Hrs. heddaya@cs.bu.edu , MCS-271, x3-8922. As an experiment, we will run the course along two tracks; each track will have a concrete goal for the class participants to reach as a group, that of writing a single collective report on a major topic of current research interest, or that of implementing a small software tool. Develop notation and formalism to speak, and reason precisely, about various desirable properties of distributed systems, of which there are multiple classes: Safety (including serializability, coherence, consistency, atomicity, etc. ), liveness , fairness , and stability (including self-stabilization). Reliability , availability , fault-tolerance , performability , and dependability . The idea is to try to reach a wide and deep understanding of the design problem of a distributed system. Only a subset of these properties need be covered in the group report, and one of our early tasks will be to select this subset, based on research value and interest of the participants. Track 2 (systems and tool). Format The weekly two hour class meeting will generally consist of two components, each furthering progress along one of the two tracks mentioned above. The first half of the course will consist of presentations by the instructor, the second half by students. The intent of this half is to bring the background of the whole class up to a point where a shared language is possible, in which research problems can be efficiently discussed. By week five of semester: schedule a date for two presentations, one for track 1, and another for track 2, email me your choice. Two weeks before your presentation: meet me in office hours to propose a topic and appropriate reading material, bring a URL, or a photocopy of the material to the meeting. In week 8: email me a one page proposal (in plain text, HTML or LaTeX only please), for your planned contribution to the group report. Early in Spring'97: The best sections will be selected, on the basis of writing quality as well as technical strength, for inclusion in a publishable paper co-authored by the respective seminar participants. Credit Course credit will be based on homework in the first half of the course, and then on presentations and written contribution to one of the two collective reports participation in class discussions, as well as on the above duties. Credit in published version of group report will depend on the level of contribution. If your entire section is included in the published version, then you will be co-author .",
