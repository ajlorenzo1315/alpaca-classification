The goal of this course is to build on the knowledge of data structures and algorithms from CIS 500 to expose the student to fundamental concepts in concurrent and distributed programming. Lectures & Readings The bulk of the concepts in the course will be presented, explained and illustrated by way of extended examples in the lectures. The programming projects are designed to provide in-depth exposure to the concepts covered in the course. There are no group projects in this class so all students are expected to do their own work. The instructor may impose punishment ranging from no credit for the work or exam to an F in the class. At a minimum, no credit will be given for the work or exam in which dishonesty occurred. READINGS The required readings for this course include a text book and selected papers from the literature. These papers are available in the holdings of the university library. The Art of Parallel Programming . Systems, Vol. In the first phase we will be covering material in the Lester text. This will provide you with a solid background on the fundamentals of parallel programming. In the second phase we will cover a number of additional topics related to parallel programming that will build off this foundation. The course will cover the following topics: Motivation for Parallel Programming Why parallelism? Synchronous Parallelism Distributed Memory Systems Communication and system topologies. Concurrent Programming Paradigms Common solution techniques and software architectures of parallel and concurrent programs: client/server, filters, token passing etc. Properties of concurrent and parallel systems. Engineering Concurrent Software Testing, Validating, Verifying concurrent systems. Schedule of topics, readings and assignments: dwyer@cis.ksu.edu",
