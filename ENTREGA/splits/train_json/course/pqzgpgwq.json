This is intended as a reference work, and the material covered in this course is not identical to that in the textbook. Office Hours Same as on the home page:  Mon - Wed, 9:00 - 10:00 AM. Course Description This course is for students in the sciences and applied mathematics whose research involves solving large sparse linear systems on a computer, and for computer scientists interested in learning the computational problems encountered in scientific and engineering codes. Existing software will also be used whenever possible, to avoid building everything from scratch, and to learn how to use existing software resources. Course goals include the ability to understand the influence of computer architecture on the choice of methods and data structures, the strengths and weaknesses of basic methods, common sources of large sparse linear systems, and the resulting implications for choosing methods and implementations. Introduction Basic linear algebra you haven't seen before Sources of large sparse linear systems Computer architecture basics Data structures and stopping tests Iterative methods: pre-1972 technology Linear stationary Conjugate gradients (CG): theory CG convergence properties Preconditioning CG Computational kernels and software resources Expressing iterative methods in terms of  kernel operations Toolkits for sparse system manipulations: Sparskit,  Sparse BLAS Packages:  PetsC, Aztec, SPLIB, Templates Finding and using numerical software from the Net Iterative methods: recent technology Basic derivation ideas: orthogonalization, restarts, truncation CG on normal equations Generalized Conjugate Residuals, Orthomin(m), GCR(m) Generalized Minimal Residuals, GMRES(m) Bi-conjugate gradients, CG-squared, CG-Stab, QMR Preconditioning and related ideas Scaling/equilibration Incomplete factorization Polynomial methods and preconditioning Other \"preconditioning\" methods Crafting a solution strategy Choice of solvers Choice of preconditioners Choice of stopping test(s) Reading  the literature: judicious use of a jaundiced eye Class Newsgroup The course newsgroup, ac.csci.b573 , will be used to post announcements, assignments, corrections, and any exceptions to usual office hours. You are responsible for checking the newsgroup frequently, since any changes or corrections to assignments will appear there. Written reports are required for these projects. Each assignment will have questions intended to begin your thinking process, not end it. Grading will also be based on the questions you raise and answer in these projects. For example, if the question is \"Which of the methods A and B is faster,\" simply saying \"A\" is not sufficient. \", etc. Most projects you can tackle in groups. However, you must give full attribution for any outside sources you use for ideas, software, or help. If your citation is \"I photocopied another student's write-up\" then you won't get many points on the assignment, but at least you won't be branded with a scarlet \"P\" and tarred and feathered. Lecture Notes This is not a full or complete set of lecture notes; in the words of a not-so-great philosopher, \"You had to be there\". If you miss a lecture, be sure to check with other students in the class for what went on. These are in Postscript, since latex2html still is not up to snuff for papers with lots of math symbols.",
