Topics include process synchronization, deadlock, memory management, input-output methods, information sharing, protection and security, and file systems. This is a fast-paced subject requiring constant attention. I'll cover some of the introductory material in class as required, but the purpose of that will be to remind the audience of the material. We'll start off with an overview of concurrency issues. We'll discuss synchronization issues - in particular, ensuring mutual exclusion, deadlock detections and prevention algorithms. We'll discuss multiprocessor issues as well. Here we'll discuss virtual memory and various methods used to implement virtual memory, such as paging and segmentation. Next, we'll cover file systems. I'll also distribute class notes which will cover the material completely. The class notes will also be available on the world wide web from the class home page at the end of each class. 2 Course Schedule We will meet Monday thru Thursday from 10:00AM-11:15AM during the weeks of 7/8 - 8/16. The first will be on 7/18 and the second will be on 8/1. The final will be on 8/16. In addition, there will be weekly assignments for the first 5 weeks of class. These will be handed out on Thursday and will be due the following Thursday at the start of the class. The final will be worth 40% and there will be two midterms worth 15% each. There will also be 4 surprise quizzes to determine the understanding of the course material by the class. 4 Policy Statement on Collaboration At most 3 people can form a group and collaborate on each homework. The quizzes and the final will be closed book and closed notes.",
