Topics will be almost entirely disjoint from those of CPS270, so students that have taken CPS270 are welcome to take this class as well. Instructor Michael L.

Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. ( book home page ) Note that Curry Guinn used the same book in CPS170 last year. From what I can tell, the overlap between the two courses (after the initial introductory material) is quite small. Prerequisites I will assume that students are familiar with programming (any language), algorithm analysis (big O notation and the like at the level of CPS130), and simple calculus (derivatives). Outline I'm going to follow the suggested syllabus in the textbook for a one-semeter course with concentration on vision and robotics. Introduction 2. Solving Problems by Searching 4.
