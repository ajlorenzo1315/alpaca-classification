Assignments Homework #8: Chapter 8 problems: 1, 9, 12, 15, 19, 23 Due in class Wednesday, November 27 Exam Review Problems Do not hand in for grading! Homework #4: Chapter 3 problems: 24, 25, 26, 34, 39, 44 NOTE: The solution to problem 34 a) has a slight mistake. Homework #1: Chapter 2 problems: 3, 5, 7, 8, 11, 15, 18, 21, 23, 24 Note that the solutions to homework #1 have some errors in them. GoldWave will, for example, convert WAV files to/from MATLAB format. If you'd like some data to play with, and don't have any of your own yet, here are 2 sample files that you can use. If you want to do your experiments on a big-endian machine (such as a Sun or HP), you should use this file, gwbsw.raw , which is the same data but it has already been byte-swapped for you. If you use the wrong file, there'll be no doubt about it when you play it over speakers or headphones. MATLAB Code Here is some MATLAB code that may be of use or of interest. Is there any sampling frequency we can use to sample u(t) so that the resulting digital signal, u(n), exhibits no frequency-domain aliasing? Realizing that the answer to the above question is \"no\", now consider the sampled signal u(n). What is the 16-point DFT of this signal? Now define the signal: y(n) = x(n), n in the range [0,15] = 0, n in the range [16,31] What is the 32-point DFT of this signal? Find the \"change of basis\" transformation. That is, find a matrix T such that: h y = T x transforms the vector of expansion coefficients x (expanded on the {bk} vectors) to the vector of expansion coefficients y (expanded on the {vk} vectors). As its name implies, this transformation maps a data vector from one basis to another. NOTE: If you can do this problem IN YOUR HEAD without doing ANY MATH, then you are in great shape (mentally speaking, of course). We'd like to keep the recitations more informal and that is hard to do if everyone comes to the same recitation. Instructor Prof. Gregory H.
