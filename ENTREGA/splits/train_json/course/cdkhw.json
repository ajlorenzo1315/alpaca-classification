Course Description Grading Policies Exam Schedule Lectures/Sections Handouts/Announcements Programming Assignments Instructors/TAs Academic Integrity - please read it and remember it well CS100B Course Description Computer Science 100b - Introduction to Computer Programming Offered in Fall 4 credits. Prerequisites: knowledge of continuous mathematics, trigonometry and calculus (Math 111 or 191, or equivalent) An introduction to elementary computer programming concepts. The subject of the course is programming, not a particular programming language. One might wonder what that means in a programming course. It means that if you think you are comfortable with integrals, derivatives, etc., CS100b will show you ways of applying your knowledge to computer programming. Regrades: If you feel an exam or a program has been incorrectly graded, fill out a regrade request giving your reasons in writing, attach the exam to it, and give it to the consultant in the Carpenter lab. If you find an error, please contact the course administrator, Laurie Buck (but please, only during her office hours). Note: since an error in our records can occur, you should probably keep your graded assignments/exams until you double-checked your grade with the posted one. Graded programs and exams are returned in sections. However, you will be registered for only one section and that will be the only one where you can pick up your graded work. If they run out, please tell it to one of the consultants there, and we will print more of them out. They are bigint.h and p4test.c . Instructors/TAs There are two instructor for CS100B. If you have any complaints about the course (assignments are too hard, or you just cannot grasp of what in the world the instructor is talking about, etc. of students working together on a program. However, cooperation should NEVER involve one student possessing  a copy of all OR a part of a program written by a student outside the group, regardless of whether that copy is on paper or on a disk. In addition, any output submitted with your program must have been produced by your program by running it as described in the assignment. ASK FIRST if you have any questions about whether a particular behavior violates our integrity expectations or the University Code.",
