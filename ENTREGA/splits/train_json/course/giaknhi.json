Larus Instructor: James Larus larus@cs.wisc.edu 5393 Computer Sciences 262-9519 http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~larus/larus.html Office hours: Tuesday 3-4 pm , Friday 11-12 am Contents Teaching Assistants Text Lecture Information Electronic Mail The C++ Language Grading Exams Course Schedule Assignment 0 Assignment 1 Assignment 2 Assignment 3 Programming Assignments Course Objectives CS367 has two objectives: Present the concepts of data structures in general and some of the most widely used structures in detail. By the end of the course, you should be able to identify situations in which a data structure is necessary, determine the requirements for the data structure, and select the appropriate data structure from those covered in this course. As there is a close connection between abstract data types and data structures, this course places a strong emphasis on applying these principles in all programming exercises. They will grade your homework assignments and will be happy to answer questions about the assignments, or any other aspect of the course that is giving you trouble. This is a well-written, if a little long-winded, text that covers most (but not all) of the material in this course. The lectures will often (but not always) follow David Dewitt's CS 367 Lecture Notes - Fall 1995 . (Also, see also the help section below.) Lecture attendence is strongly recommended as I will regularly present material that does not appear in the textbook or lecture notes, but will be useful for the programming assignments and exams. The exams will be based on the lecture material, reading assignments in the notes, and the course assignments. I assume that you regularly read your electronic mail. Grading There will be one or two evening exams during the semester, a final exam and five programming assignments. The C++ Language CS 367 will be taught using the C++ programming language, and programming assignments must be written in C++. There is also another WWW page with more information on the programming assignments. Turn in an index card with the following information: Name and login name Year in school (freshman, sophomore, ...) Previous CS courses Previous programming experience Recent photograph of you. No CS367 grades will be given without a photo! Assignment 1 The first programming assignment is to write a simple abstract data byte for a bounded integer sequence. The text of the assignment is on-line. Assignment 2 The second programming assignment is to write a program to maintain a database of scores for a tennis tournament. The text of the assignment is on-line. The text of the assignment is on-line.",
