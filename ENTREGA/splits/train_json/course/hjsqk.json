This research area should motivate you to independent reading and thinking. You will spend at least 6 hours per week in laboratory work or reading. You may work in a group to understand the material and questions, but everything you turn in or pass off should be your work. Class Adminstration Homework Questions Schedule: Laboratories: Sample Exams Projects: Available documents: The following papers are included as background material to the topics we will discuss in the class. This page describes many of the issues involved in video transmission over IP and ATM networks. A Proposed Flow Specification (RFC1363) for ATM networks. The focus of this paper is running IP over ATM, but there is an extensive tutorial on ATM. A good source of ATM references Sample socket code is available through anonymous ftp from timp.cs.byu.edu in the pub/sockets directory or is available here as a shar file. Information on UNIX The Computer For The 21st Century Scientific American Paper ATM FAQ The ATM Blue Book has extensive information about protocols, standards and products used with ATM. I think the thesis is a good prototype for research in this field and has a fairly good bibliography and intro to ATM. Performance Analysis of parallel library interfaces to ATM Networks. Also the ATM with PVM paper and ATM communication results and ATM pointers. A paper on ATM Switch Architectures is also available. We also have sample FORE client and server code. The CCITT standards documents are here. Pointers to SNMP and other ATM standards and papers are here. MPEG traffic analysis by Garrett.",
