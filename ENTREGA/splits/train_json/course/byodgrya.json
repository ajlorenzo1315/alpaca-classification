PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT DEADLINES, LATE DAYS, AND EARLY DAYS There are four phases or programming assignments, as follows: Title                         Points     \t\tDue Date Phase 1 : Primitives             85 points \tOctober 2, 1996 Phase 2 : 2D Graphics\t   85 points \tOctober 23, 1996 Phase 3 : 3D Graphics\t   85 points \tNovember 22, 1996 Phase 4 : Three Options   85 points \tDecember 13, 1996 Ray Tracing or Fractals or Animation (choose 1 option only) Total Points:                      340 points You may earn up to 100 points in any phase. Emphasis is given to fundamental computer graphics elements that are common to all general purpose 3D computer graphics packages. The goal of this course is to allow you to gain an understanding of the important fundamental algorithms and techniques used in computer graphics. First, scan ahead and read all parts of the text that have something to do with your implementation. Design your package ahead of time. There simply is not enough time in the semester to finish your package if you wait until a concept is discussed in class before you begin to think about it or to implement it. While this philosophy may be odd to some, this is the only way you can produce a good package in this class given the unavoidable time constraints common to university courses and to actual production environments. Read other texts and any other material that may give more information on a subject or explain it better. To make pass-offs manageable for the TA, you must pass-off your package on a computer located on BYU's campus which you have authorized access to. Otherwise, you will be under the necessity of transporting your computer to campus for each pass-off, which might not be convenient for you unless the computer is a laptop. If you choose this option please include the ability to print out the commands and parameters on a simple help screen. All required functionality must be completed. The balance of points for each section may be earned by completing optional items listed in each category. There are 85 points for each of the four phases for a total of 340 possible points. Up to 20 points may be deducted for each assignment if the interface does not facilitate adequate testing of the functionality. This restriction applies only to the graphics code specified by this assignment. RESOURCES Many of the options can be programmed using only information from the text book. IMPORTANT NOTE: not all of the graphics books are available in the library \"on the shelf\".",
