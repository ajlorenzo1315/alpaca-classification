Who Should Take This Course This course is designed for students who have little or no experience in computer science and who want a general overview of the field. However, you can still take it if you wish to use it to raise your grade. The final exam for this class is on Wednesday, 18 December from 7 to 10 PM. Here's the whole schedule . We've decided that the T-F question on the quiz about right-clicking to download an image was poorly worded. If you lost half a point on this question, bring your quiz by my office in D328 (or slip it under the door) and I'll fix your grade. Grading Approximate weights Programs, problems 20% Programming test (aka Lab Final, in labs) 10% Quizzes (every week after Wednesday lecture) 25% Midterm Exam (Wednesday, 16 October) 20% Final Exam (as indicated on official schedule) 25% Policies Each student must write his or her own programs without help from other persons. The lowest two quizzes will not be counted. No make-up quizzes will be given. Late homeworks, programs, or labs will receive 80% of full credit if they are handed in within seven days o the regular due date. The grade of I (incomplete) will be administered as specified by University rules. Thus it will be not given to those students who simply did not complete the course on time. The final exam is not optional and every student will be required to take it at the scheduled time unless a written excuse from the Dean is presented. Students who receive 85% or higher on the midterm exam may skip the lab final programming test. Their final grades will be based upon their average in other parts of the course. If you click on the topic for a day you will see a handout for that day.
