Grades There will be four programming assignments, counting 10% each, and three exams, counting 20% each; the third exam will be at the scheduled time and place for the final. Topics Covered The following order of topics isn't entirely logical, but is designed so that the topic for each programming assignment is discussed before the program is due. Introduction to Lisp (Program 1) Searching and Game Playing (Program 2) Introduction to Prolog Natural Language Understanding (Program 3) Learning and Neural Networks (Program 4) Logical Deduction Planning Reasoning with Uncertain Knowledge Lisp Information Since Lisp is used in a lot (not all!) of AI programming, the course will begin with a discussion of COMMON Lisp. It would probably be useful to have some Lisp reference available to supplement the lectures and the on-line help available within lisp itself. Another possibility: The ANSI Common Lisp Book by Graham. Code used in the book is on line. Also available on line.
