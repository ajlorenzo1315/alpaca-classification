Expand the creativity of the students in all aspects of computing. Text: J. Mclelland and D. Rumelhart, Explorations in Parallel Distributed Processing:  A Handbook of Models, Programs, and Exercises. You will be expected to read the assigned literature beforeand optionally after the scheduled lecture. Lab (3346 TMCB): 4 Mac II's with 5MB RAM and 40 MB hard drives. will be made available. Literature: I have placed interesting and representative papers for reference in the periodicals room of the HBLL library. I also have more papers in my office which can be looked over and copied under constraint of the 15 minute rule. Grading (~): Simulations and Homeworks: 30%, Midterm: 22.5%, Project: 22.5%, Final: 25% (Tue., Dec. 14,  7am-10am). If you think, you'll be all right Late assignments: Assignments are expected on time (beginning of class on due date). Late papers will be  marked off at 5%/school day late. ), which you inform me of, then I will not take off any late points. Project: An indepth effort on a particular aspect of neural networks. Good projects are typically as follows: Best:  Some of your own original thinking and proposal of a network, learning paradigm, system, etc. Not Good:  A description of a current model. Note that in a semester course like this, you will have to choose a topic when we have only covered half of the material. to peruse and find any topic of interest to you, regardless of whether we have or will cover it in class. Intro to Neural Networks (1) * 2. Definitions, Theory, learning, applications, and General Mechanisms of Neural Networks (2) 5. Oral Presentations (2)              Final Project Paper *As a general rule, read all of the papers at then end of a section of notes before the lecture.",
