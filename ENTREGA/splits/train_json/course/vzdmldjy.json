One copy of this book will be on reserve at the Science and Engineering library after 9/10/96. You will read most of the textbook in this course. If you haven't done so but still want to remain in the course, please see me. Accordingly, we will develop several formal models of computation, each more powerful than the last. Homework Assignments When writing up your homework, there are two goals you must keep in mind: first, to give evidence that you have put real thought into the problem, and second, to convince the reader that your solution is correct and that you know why . The single most important thing you can do to make your solutions presentable is to rewrite them after you have discovered why they are correct, and then to throw away (or at least tuck away) your initial draft. Assignments turned in during one of the two class periods following the due date will be graded at 60% of their face value. L com- + laborare to labor] 1: to work jointly with others esp. an occupying force 3: to cooperate with an agency or instrumentality with which one is not immediately connected - col.lab.o.ra.tion n Collaboration is encouraged (primarily in the first and third senses) when working on homework problems and preparing for exams. None of the problems in this class are intended to have secret solutions; the more resourceful you are at discovering solutions, the more time you will have to write them well. Indeed, if you are stuck on a problem, I will be happy to talk with you about it during office hours. Copying a prepared solution is not collaboration at all; it is plagiarism. Do not copy another person's work and present it as your own. And, obviously, it's easier to learn things from a teacher than directly from the book.
