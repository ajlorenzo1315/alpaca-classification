Catalog description Examines process synchronization; I/O techniques, buffering, file systems; processor scheduling; memory management; virtual memory; job scheduling, resource allocation; system modeling; and performance measurement and evaluation. An operating system controls and operates disparate hardware resources so as to shield programs and users from idiosyncrasies of individual devices, and from such nasty phenomena as concurrency , asynchrony and failure . In this course, we will study the design and construction of major subsystems of an operating system, and examine some of the core problems in detail. We will not focus on the difficulties of integrating the various subsystems into a coherent whole, as we might do if this were a project course. [Tan 95] Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Distributed Operating Systems, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 1995. Requirements Credit for the course will be based on ~8 homework assignments (60%), and on midterm (15%) and final (25%) exams. Late homeworks go to the grader's mailbox or mailfolder in the CS Dept. main office (MCS 138). Lateness Homeworks are penalized 5% of the maximum grade per day of delay. If you must, please request an extension as soon as you realize you need it. Collaboration I encourage you to collaborate in studying and on homeworks. That is, what you submit should be entirely your original expression, except for what you specifically credit to other sources. For example, copying without attribution any part, however small, of someone else's program constitutes plagiarism---even if you modify it, and even if the source is a textbook. Standards of academic conduct treat cheating and plagiarism very seriously, because they impede the drive for originality and invention that have been the hallmark of human progress.
