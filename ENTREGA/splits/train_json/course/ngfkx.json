    "Cuerpo": "We will read and discuss a handful of recent papers that will give students an appreciation for the state of the art. I will make a number of presentations to introduce students to the background material necessary to read the research papers---only undergraduate-level computer science knowledge and basic probability theory and calculus will be assumed. Instructor Michael L. Littman Office: D209 LSRC Phone: 660-6537 Email: mlittman@cs.duke.edu Office hours: TBA Description Research in planning, making a sequence of choices to achieve some goal, has been a mainstay of artificial intelligence (AI) for many years. As a result, to get a deep appreciation for this work, we will need to read a number of papers that introduce the necessary background. My approach to organizing the seminar will be to try to keep the assigned reading to a minimum and to ask students to concentrate on understanding the state of the field and on identifying the important open research questions. Postrequisites In addition to exploring the question of how to create plans that are effective in uncertain environments, there are a number of other important topics that students will learn about in this seminar: students will be exposed to Markov decision processes, dynamic programming, linear programming, temporal difference learning, supervised function approximation, gradient descent and neural networks, STRIPS rules, and partial order planning. Andrew G. Barto, S. J. Bradtke and Satinder P. Singh. A wildly successful example of this is TD-Gammon; this work makes use of several important background ideas including gradient descent and temporal difference learning that we will need to look at as well. Reinforcement learning for dynamic channel allocation in cellular telephone systems. ( compressed postscript , Recent workshop on value function approximation ) These results were not convincing to everyone. Residual algorithms: Reinforcement learning with function approximation. In Armand Prieditis and Stuart Russell, editors, Proceedings of the Twelfth International Conference on Machine Learning , 30--37, 1995. Fast planning through planning graph analysis. ( postscript ) Slides: postscript In spite of recent algorithmic advances, the traditional view of planning ignores uncertainty. In Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence , 1994. Several papers adopt the view that function approximation is a form of ``abstraction,'' the form of which can be derived automatically from a propositional representation of the planning problem.

( postscript ) Project Ideas The major thrust of the seminar will be to undertake a group project exploring some facet of the problem of planning under uncertainty. Some sample project ideas are: Are there methods of efficiently evaluating plans in complex domains?",
