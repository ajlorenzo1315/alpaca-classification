    "Cuerpo": "Course Content This course is an introduction to application development in the Unix environment using the C++ language. We will cover the following topics: basic Unix control structures, functions, arrays, structs I/O streams, strings, pointers, references, bits OO concepts, objects, classes, methods, messages function overloading, constructors, destructors dynamic memory allocations, recursive data structures inheritance, polymorphism, templates linking external libraries, makefile shell programming, processes, signals, pipes A detailed course outline , with week-by-week course schedule, is also abuilding. Glass, Graham, Unix for Programmers and Users, A Complete Guide , Prentice Hall, 1993. In addition, there will be homework problems assigned in lecture that will be due the following lecture. The exam is on Friday, May 3 at 8 - 10 a.m. Grading Grades are calculated as follows: Quizzes 25% Participation 10% Projects 40% Final 25% Note: You must pass the final exam to pass the course! Programming Projects This is the most important component to the course. There will be a project due every week. You will submit your source code electronically using the S212 handin program. This handin program does not compile, run, debug, or test your code (that's your job); it merely saves your file in a convenient location so your AI can grade it later. You may submit a program as many times as you want up to the deadline. Project descriptions will appear below as they are assigned. In general, solutions to the programming projects will not be supplied. Project 9, Due 3/7 Project 10, Due 3/27 Project 11, Due 4/4 Project 12, Due 4/11 Project 13, Due 4/18 Course Evaluations Course evaluations will be performed electronically. At some point you should receive an email message containing your individual password, which you'll need to gain entry into the system. As the end of the semester approaches, we'll provide a link into the evaluation system. No student will be allowed to do ``extra work'' to raise his final grade or to make up missing work. Programs are due on the announced date, because solutions may be discussed immediately thereafter;  late assignments would be accepted only under the conditions similar to what could justify an Incomplete. All grades become final one week after the material is returned to you. You are expected to complete all work independently. Cases of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Office of Student Ethics, a branch of the Office of the Dean of Students.",
