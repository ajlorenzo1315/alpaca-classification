UNDERGRADUATE CONSULTANT: Michael Mark, is a consultant on duty for this course. He holds consulting hours in the \"fishbowl\" area on the 2nd floor of CSE near the CIRCA labs (just to the left as you enter the lab) with this current schedule. Here are the current hours: In that discussion section, you will 1) take occasional quizzes (announced or not), 2) receive instruction on C++ implementation details of the abstractions you are learning, and 3) get instructions and guidance on the assigned personal and homework projects which you will submit on-line. You will using Borlands Turbo C++ on any CIRCA machines on campus. If you submit a homework early and then improve upon it, you may resubmit. Homework may be submitted late if there has not been a solution given out or discussed in class. The penalty is 15% for each 24 hours or fraction thereof. ==== 750 COP 3530                Spring 1996      Dr. Crummer      PAGE 2 of 2 ANTICIPATED COURSE CONTENT AND SCHEDULE: Week    Text Number\tPages\tChapter  \tTopics =====   ======  =======\t\t====== 1\t1-45\t    1\t\tProblem solving & Software Engineering A1-A26\t    \t\tAppendix, Summary of C++ fundamentals 3\t71-95\t    2\t\tMad scientist, Searching, Binary search 6       140-164\t    4\t\tPointers, Pointer-based linked lists 7\t164-184\t    4\t\tMore on linked lists implementations and variations 8       203-222\t    5\t\tUsing Recursion: Towers, Lists, Backtracking 12\t353-372\t    8\t\tClass relationships, virtual functions, late binding, abstract base class 15      437-503     10 \t\tBinary tree: as an ADT, implementations, traversals, and applications ============================================================================ In addition to the homework projects you submit electronically, here are your personal homework exercises from the textbook: Pages  Exercise Number -----  --------------- 94\t1,2,4 95\t2,4,7,9,13,19 137\t1,2,3,5,7 193\t1,2,3,5 196\t3,7,8,9 198\t28,33 241\t14,15,16,17 296\t2,4,6,7,9 298\t1,2,6,8,11,14 388\t2,3,4,7 390\t2a,7 504 \t1-10 505\t2a,3,6,7,11a-c FINAL EXAM MONDAY APRIL 29, 1996  (3:00-5:00 PM, CSE 222 or TBA) EMail: crummer@cis.ufl.edu",
