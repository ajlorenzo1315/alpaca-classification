Algorithms, complexity analysis, data structuring, data and procedural abstraction, grammars, correctness, logic principles, processor organization, operating system concepts, programming languages, basic automata theory, and theoretical limitations. The entire book is also on-line in Microsoft word on KATO, the Mac server, in the folder KATO.HOME/Department Homes/CS/CS 60/. Threads There are essentially three interwoven \"threads\" in the course: The book, the problems, and the lectures. Staying attune to what is going on in lecture will help you focus on the areas in the book that are important as far as exam emphasis. You can get help on-line by emailing to cs60help@muddcs which goes to the graders/tutors and to me. If you do not want it to be attributed to you, please so indicate in your message. I will explain to you how to work any problem, to any level of detail, if you ask. You are also welcome to submit email or a note card with any question you'd like to have answered or any point you would like addressed before or after class, or leave it in my mailbox in 240 Olin. There will may be one assignment in assembly-language programming, using a simulated computer, the ISC. Is this a \"Programming Course\"? In developing code for a programming assignment, you can discuss ideas with others, but discussion of ideas must not involve wholesale examination or transcription of the actual working code of others, with the exception that you may use any code explicitly provided by the instructor. If the help you get from another is significant, you should acknowledge it on your submission. If you have any doubts about whether a form of interaction constitutes a violation of this standard, please consult with me prior to continuing. These do not need to be submitted, but the exams will consist largely of problems of a similar level, along with some perhaps a little easier or harder. In other words, if the due date states day N, then the assignment must be turned in before midnight on day N+1 to receive any credit. After midnight on day N+1 work you spend on the problem is for you own edification only (which is not to say that it isn't worth doing or required; you just don't get points for it then). It is best to plan to get the assignments in on the stated due date. Programming in logic. Regular expressions and finite-state machines.",
