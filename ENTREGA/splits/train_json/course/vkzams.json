E-mail:  hczhu@cs ******  Added October 2, at 4:30 pm The code we will review Thursday Oct 3 is in file ~cs130a/files/llist.C You may one to see the one used last year which does the same thing but in a slightly different way. That program is in file ~cs130a/files/95llist.C Copy them into your directory and type: g++ llist.C then type a.out Sample input (one number per line): 6 7 5 4 3 0 7 6 8 9 1 2 3 0 *************************** October 9, 1996   3:00 pm *************************** You may use the listitarator class for the hw, as long as it results in a time efficient procedure as without it, (time efficient with respect to O notation). Remember, we want time efficient code, but do not try to optimize to the last bit (i.e., do not try to reduce to the last bit the constant \"c\" in the O notation for the time complexity). (4) An example for the project is in ~cs130a/files/example Comments on the project: The root node in both figures should have a 9 instead of an 8 *************************** October 16, 1996   1:00 pm *************************** Comments on the project: The root node in both figures should have a 9 instead of an 8 *************************** October 17, 1996   1:00 pm *************************** Just called the RBR and they said the old midterms for cs130a are there. *************************** October 18, 1996   5:00 pm *************************** As we said in the first handout: you must work in the project (and homeworks) individually. In the project handout (page 6) I say that x is followed by a CR. I should have said that x is followed by a CR or a blank. A little C++ program to read data is in file ~cs130a/files/read.C *************************** October 18, 1996   7:00 pm *************************** In the project I say that when a ArrayTrieNode or a LinkedTrieNode has a count that becomes 1 it should become a TinyTrieNode. They are also in the file ~cs130a/files/hw1.ps You can print that file or view it with ghostscript hw1.ps The press the left bottom on the dismiss sign if it appears. Additional information on ghostview appears when you type man hw1.ps In the hw it should say that Bogdan Cocosel is a co-author of the solutions. In the file ~cs130a/files/proj.C and the file ~cs130a/files/projh.C you will find code to access and create the two examples in the project handout. *************************** October 28, 1996   10:30 am *************************** As we say in the project description we are dealing with sets, so we do not keep multiple copies of the same word in the same set. But one might try to insert a word in a set that is already there or delete a word that is not in a set. In the first case you must not insert the word and the count needs to remain unchanged. If you implement insert as in the class notes, you will have to make to passes over the Trie in some cases. *************************** October 28, 1996   15:30 pm *************************** Remember that the final type of a node DEPENDS on the NUMBER OF WORDS in that subtree  It DOES NOT depend on the number of nodes or the number of nonnull pointers in that subtree. *************************** October 31, 1996   15:15 pm *************************** The Office hours of the TAs on Wednesday and Friday will be in CSIL from now till December. It would be nice if you specify the times and days you want it be open, and if you would like to \"babysit\" the machines.",
