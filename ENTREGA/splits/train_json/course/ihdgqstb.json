    "TÃ­tulo": "C211 and H211 Course Description",
    "Cuerpo": "The study of computer programming is therefore the study of solving problems with a computer, but it is also much more. The programming language we use in this class is Scheme. Then you will be in a better position to study C++ in your next computer science course, C212. We hope that you will enjoy it as much as we do. The students should be able to use procedures as first-class objects, that is, pass them as arguments and also write programs whose values are procedures. They should be able to use locally-defined procedures. Students should be able to use abstraction, both with data in making programs independent of the data representation, and also with procedures in abstracting the structure of programs. They should also be able to write both linear and binary search programs. Students should be able to read programs and have an appreciation of what constitutes good programming style. Modifying someone else's code (or even your own, a few months later) may be a joy or a nightmare--depending on how clearly the program is written. We will cover most of the first three-quarters of this text. Syllabus and Lecture Scripts Most of the first three-quarters of the text Scheme and the Art of Programming will be covered. Assignments will be posted on or before Wednesday afternoon and will be due electronically by 5:00 p.m. on the Wednesday of the following week. Although assignments count for only 10% of the final grade, it is essential that you do the assignments to master the material. Programming assignments are submitted using the program c211-handin (in the directory ~c211/bin on copper and zinc). After the final submission of an assignment, it will not only be electronically graded, but an Associate Instructor will also grade the assignment for style. In this course good style is also rewarded in the evaluation of exams. It will be updated with additional information, such as programming assignments, as the course progresses. Evaluation 10% -- Assignments 28% -- Exam 1, 7:30-9:00 p.m., Tuesday, October 8th Study Guide and Room Assignments for the First Midterm Examination. Gradebooks The Electronic Gradebook for this course will be updated with each assignment and exam.",
