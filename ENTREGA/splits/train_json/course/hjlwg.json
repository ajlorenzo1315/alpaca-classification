Wise , dswise@cs.indiana.edu Associate Instructors Eliana Colunga ecolunga@cs.indiana.edu Rutvik Desai rudesai@cs.indiana.edu Prerequisite C212 (C++), and corequisite C251. Do not post anonomously. You might also want to regularly read cs.students for postings pertinent to students in our CS department. We will cover the following topics: Abstract Data Types; Linear sturctures, stack, queues, dequeues; Linear allocation, linked allocation; Circular linking, Double linking, Header cells; Classic algorithms illustrating good use of these structures; Trees, Binary trees, Naturally corresponding binary trees; Tree traversal: preorder; inorder; postorder. (How to tell the forest from the trees.) In addition, there will be homework problems assigned in lecture that will be due the following lecture. The exams are subjective (written paragraphs, code) mostly, and it is difficult to assure that one point on the first quiz is the same value as another point on the final exam. Notably, the first is a Jewish holiday, and some others, as well, may be absent;  of course, there shall be a make-up quiz on September 24 for any students also affected. The exam is on Monday, December 16 at 10:15am - 12:15pm Grading Grades are calculated as follows: In-class tests 48% Participation 4% Programming Assignments 48% Note: You must pass the final exam to pass the course! There will be a programming assigment due almost every week on Thursday or Friday. Later in the course you will be able to notice that these are structured into two streams, and solving an early problem in the stream is necessary to easy solutions to the later ones. This handin program does not compile , run, debug, or test your code (that's your job); it merely saves your file in a convenient location so your AI can grade it later. Programs that do not compile will earn zero points. In general, solutions to the programming projects will not be supplied. Programs are due by 11:59 p.m. or 4:59 p.m., according to the system clock, on the specified date.

Programs are due on the announced date, because solutions may be discussed immediately thereafter;  late assignments would be accepted only under the conditions similar to what could justify an Incomplete. All grades become final one week after the material is returned to you. Of course, we encourage discussion and debates over the course material, but you are expected to complete all work independently. Similarly, we encourage you to use libraries both of books and of computer programs but, whenever you use such archival material, you must cite the source completely.",
