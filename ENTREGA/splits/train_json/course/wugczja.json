Course Notes on Scheme and its Implementation in html for web browsing. I suggest that you use this web page with a browser while using a Scheme system interactively. THERE ARE ERRORS IN THIS TEXT, especially the later chapters. For most stuff in this course, my Scheme course notes will be more helpful, but if you want to know about miscellanous functions and exactly what they do, this is the authority. First set of Practice Questions . There's also a version with answers . There's also a version with answers . There's also a version with answers . Notes on naming conventions and indenting for Scheme , which you should consult when doing homework so that I can read your code and grade it sensibly, and notes on drawing data structures . Scheme code for a simple object-based programming system based on classes and generic procedures (inheritance not implemented yet). The main language we'll be using in this course is Scheme , and by default the implementation to use is RScheme , which is installed on the public cs SPARCs (running Solaris) and RS6000's (running AIX). If you use your own machine, and you're running Linux or Solaris or any of several other implementations of UNIX, you can get RScheme and install it on your machine---it's free. If you're using a PC running Windows or DOS, I'm not sure what the best Scheme to get is. There are a bunch available at the Scheme Repository. The Scheme Repository The Scheme Repository at the University of Indiana has lots of free implementations of Scheme, and various documents on Scheme.
