A major component of your grade will be determined by a large multi-part compiler implementation project . There will be an open-book open-note in-class final exam . The weighting used for the final grade will be : 50%project, 30%final exam and 20%homeworks and quizes. The project consists of implementing a compiler for a Pascal-like language with classes. You may write your compiler in C, C++, Pascal or Ada (if you really want to write it in another language come and talk to me). This parser will produce an abstract syntax tree intermediate representation from which code will be generated. Your compiler will generate assembly code for the MIPS R2000/R3000. If you don't already know about machine architecture and assembly language programming you might start to browse the spim document. The compiler will be implemented in four phase: Scanner with identifier table Parser with type checking Embellish Parser to build IR Optimize IR Code Generator The project can be implemented either independently or in pairs. This will involve building an additional phase to perform the IR optimization. You will not be graded on the quality of the generated code. You are encouraged to use these to test your implementation. I may execute your projects on those (and other) test files. You may also create tests of your own. If you copy other's work you will not be prepared for the exam and you will not maximize the benefit you get from this course. SCHEDULE ACADEMIC HONESTY On all assignments, you are expected to do your own work. Matt Dwyer ( dwyer@cis.ksu.edu ) Last updated 10 Aug 1996",
