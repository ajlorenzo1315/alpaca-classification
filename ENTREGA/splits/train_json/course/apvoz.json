Purchasing it for the course is strongly recommended. Reference Books \"Modern Operating Systems,\" by A. S. Tanenbaum (Prentice Hall) \"The Design of the UNIX Operating System,\" by M. J. Bach (Prentice Hall, on reserve ) \"Operating Systems,\" by W. Stallings ( on reserve ) Theses books complement the textbook, and are not required. Perusing them may help better understanding some issues discussed in class. Homeworks should be returned on the due day in class. Projects will be submitted electronically. Project In this course we will not only talk about operating systems; we will actually build one. If you don't like the smell of burning tires, forget it. If you need somebody to hold you by the hand (like, memory protection) you are in really bad shape. Fortunately (for you) most of the machines here are used by real people trying to get real work done. They (and the system support staff) would resent it heavily if we started tinkering with the operating system on some of the machines. In this semester we will therefore be playing with and improve upon a simulated operating system. The simulation is rather sophisticated and simulates the system to quite some detail. The implementation of that system is such that you should be able to concentrate on the OS issues, and not have to worry about the simulation. Nevertheless, you will be exposed to quite some tricky situations, which will foster your understanding of what is (or at least what should be) going on in an OS. The environment for the projects is written in C++, which gives a nice opportunity to some of you to get a little experience in writing simple object-oriented code. For the students who are not familiar with C++, a short introduction of the most important concepts will be given in class. A working knowledge of C will be assumed.
