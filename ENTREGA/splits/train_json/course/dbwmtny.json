    "Cuerpo": "It is assumed that you have taken C211 here at Indiana, and so are familiar with the Scheme programming language. In formalizing meaning we draw more heavily on logic, both as a way to express ideas about programs and as a discipline for describing what computers are and what they do. One reason (not the only one) we look at logic in this course is for the purpose of evaluating proof narratives. I may have to skip more chapters, depending on our progress through the material. Supplementary material is (or will be) included below the chapter listing in some cases. Chapter 3:  Induction and Recursion (4 weeks) Skim Sections 3.2 and 3.5 Notes from meetings: 13, 14, 15 February 20 through March 5 Chapter 9: Program Correctness Proofs (1-2 weeks) Notes from meetings: 16th-? tentative Chapter 7: Graphs and Trees (1 week) tentative Chapter 10: Grammars, Languages, and Parsing (1-2 weeks) tentative Selected topics: time permitting Homework assignments In studying the textbook material, you should work enough exercises and problems in the text to ensure that you understand the material. Since many of the discussions in class will derive from these exercises, we should be certain that at least one individual has worked through every one of them, so every problem has assigned to it one or two students who are expected to be able to present the problem at a class meeting. Most homeworks will not be graded for credit; the purpose of these assignments is to guide participants in preparing for the presentation of material in the class, and to show the kinds of problems that will be asked on examinations. In this course, you are welcome to discuss assignments, presentations, and challenges with other students. If you are working with a group, please indicate it on your homework papers. Grading and gradebooks The gradebook will be posted on this home page and updated regularly. For this honors class I would like to place greater emphasis on interation and participation than on formal examinations and assignments. 20% for Exam 1, to be scheduled during the discussion session (W, 7:15-9:15), week and location to be announced. 20% for Exam 2, to be scheduled during the discussion session (W, 7:15-9:15), week and location to be announced. The scheduled office hours are reserved for S251 students, but you are welcome and encouraged to drop by at other times. To encourage participation, credit will be given to those students who submit a full evaluation during the week prior to final examinations. Not all the material presented in this course is in the text book. If you have not already done so, please read the Computer Science Department's Statement on Academic Integrity to be sure you understand the rules under which computer science courses operate. Cases of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Office of Student Ethics, a branch of the Office of the Dean of Students.",
