    "Cuerpo": "691M: Logic and Formal Methods ,   Fall, 1996 Meeting Times: MW 9:05-10:20,  LGRC: A339 Instructor: Neil Immerman Aim of the Course: We will provide introductions to propositional, predicate, and modal logics. These will be studied and used throughout the course as tools for the specification and verification of properties of programs and protocols. Topics: First-Order Logic: propositional logic, predicate logic, completeness and compactness theorems, semantics via quantifier games, Gödel's incompleteness theorem. Modal logic: temporal logic and logics of knowledge, axiomitization, semantics via Kripke structures. Temporal Logic of Actions: Lamport's system of specification and verification via temporal logic Distributed Protocols: we will use logics of knowledge to express correctness and security of distributed protocols. You should have read van Dalen through page 118. Note that in this course we are only interested in the countable case, so you do not need to worry about larger cardinalities nor do you have to remember Zorn's lemma. These are the best and most pleasant way to figure out what can and cannot be expressed in first-order logics. On Wednesday, Oct. 9, I finished the introduction to Predicate Logic. By now, please skim the rest of Chapter 3 of van Dalen. Second Problem Set, Due: Oct. 16, 1996 On Oct. 16 I introduced Evolving Algebra. Please read the Evolving Algebra Tutorial , and the paper guide.ps. Also available on the Evolving Algebra Homepage . On Oct. 23, 28, and 30, I will give a three-lecture introduction to modal logics, emphasizing temporal logic and logics of knowledge. I will also use some material from the book by Fagin, Halpern, Moses, and Vardi, Reasoning about Knowledge, 1995, M.I.T. On Monday, Nov. 4, I will talk about about an interesting paper that uses logic of knowledge to discuss security in distributed systems: A Logic of Authentication by Burrows, Abadi, and Needham. Please read this paper before the class. On Wednesday, Nov. 6 through Monday, Nov. 18, I will talk about Lamport's Temporal Logic of Actions . You might want to look at the following webpage which has many pointers to work going on in formal methods: Formal Methods Pointers On Wednesday, Nov. 20, I will start talking about Computation Tree Logic and Model Checking. For a preview, take at look at the following homepage: Model Checking at CMU .",
