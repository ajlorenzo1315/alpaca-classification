    "Cuerpo": "Please let Dr. Windley know if there's anything we can do to improve it. in this assignment you will explore Haskell and see how it relates to other languages with which you are familiar. Think about how it compares with other languages you know such as Pascal, C++, Scheme, Lisp, Prolog. Pick some part of Haskell that appeals to you or you think is interesting and explore that in depth . More information on the Haskell Programming language  is available here. Assignment 2: Programming with Lists Using Chapter 3 of Reade and Chapter 3 in Davie as references, explore the use of lists in Haskell. This paper may be an extension of what you did last week or a new topic. In fact, its so easy to define simple interpreters using concrete datatypes to represent abstract syntax and pattern-matching functions as the interpreter that the literature is full of examples of small interpreters defined in functional languages. Paper: Week of September Sep 30th. I'd like you to explore the use of functional languages to define the operational semantics of languages. There are some interesting extensions to what you'll find in Reade. For example, can you define an interpreter for a small assembly language and then define a translator from Reade's language into your assembly language? Does interpreting a chunk of code using the interpret function give the result as translating it and then running it on your assembly language interpreter? There are a lot of place to go with this. Note that you have two weeks to work on this. Your groups will not meet with me the week of the 23rd since I'll be out of town Thursday and Friday. Since you have two weeks to work on this, I'll expect the papers to be higher quality and the work to be more  complete. (continued to week of Oct 14th) Assignment 5: Denotational Semantics Read and explore chapter 10 of Reade. Paper: During the week of Oct 21st, I'd like a preliminary paper that we can discuss.
