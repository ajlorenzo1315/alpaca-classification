The primary focus of the Wednesday meetings will be topics related to the projects (including introduction to the Java programming language), but time will also be available for answering any questions you have regarding points raised in the the lectures or the text. Projects There will be five programming projects, all in the Java programming language. Sun SparcStation workstations running the Solaris dialect of the Unix operating system are provided for your use, but you may use any computer to which you have access that implements the Java programming language. On all but the first project, students will be required to work in pairs. You can use these late days on different assignments (e.g., one day on each of three assignments) or all three days on one assignment. Many of the reasons for Java's growing popularity have little to do with the way we will use it in this course (we will discuss these issues in class), but a byproduct of this course will be knowledge of Java, which is becoming quite a marketable commodity. Grading There will be a midterm and a final exam, each of which will count for 25% of your grade.
