Lecture schedule (overview) (TOC) Weeks 1, 2, 3: Introduction and Data Modeling Introduction -- relational databases -- algebra, calculus and QBE -- object-oriented databases -- Track data model -- algebra, rule language, and visual language Weeks 4, 5: Digital Media Digital signal processing -- audio -- digital audio -- video -- digital video -- audio compression -- video compression Weeks 6, 7: Data Visualization Mental models - human information processing - Metaphors and analogies -- Visualizing data: hierarchical, relational, object oriented, time-based -- Visualizing queries: boolean, relational, object-oriented, time-based Weeks 8-11: Student lectures Each student will present a lecture on a topic of their choice. February 6 Munish: Digital audio Chapter 1 of Pohlman, K.C. February 8 Munish: Digital video Chapter 2 of Watkinson, J. February 13 Munish: Human computer interaction Chapter 2 of Shneiderman, B. An introductory treatment to both these approaches is in chapter 11 of Shneiderman, B. This is problematic because (1) not all the data is concurrently visible, (2) navigation through the data is slow, and (3) no attempt at providing context is made. A data model for video databases is presented based on a study of the applilcations of video, the nature of video retrieval requests, and the features of video. The data model is used in the architectural framework of a video database. Aditya Khosla: Towards an optimal operating system for multimedia My talk will be based on a survey paper that addresses key issues that an operating system needs to possess in order to efficiently handle multimedia systems. The usefulness of these guidelines for actual design will be discussed in the context of advantages and disadvantages of each approach. 1993 ) will be described in greater detail to illustrate the application of cognitive and anthropomorphic methods to database interface issues. First, it will serve as a guide for the user using your system. What does the user gain by using your system? Here are some criterion which may be used in choosing the capabilities for implementation in iteration 1: they must be implementable by the due date, they should constitute a significant element of your system. 1994 User Interface Design.
