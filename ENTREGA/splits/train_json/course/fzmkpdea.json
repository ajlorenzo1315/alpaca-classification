NOTE: Exam 4 will take place during the final exam period and will only be as long as the previous exams, a maximum of 55-60 minutes. NOTE: ERROR IN THE PRINTED SCHEDULE OF CLASSES The Wednesday lab, Section 1109, meets from 10:10 - 11:00, NOT 9:05-9:55. If you take the Monday/Wednesday lecture (Section 1107), you are encouraged to take the Wednesday lab (Section 1109). If you take the Tuesday/Thursday lecture (Section 1108), you are encouraged to take the Thursday lab (Section 1110). Since this is the first time we've done it, it's impossible to predict just how much we will be able to cover. In general, there are two areas I want cover: the technical and the practical. It's the sort of thing you can't or don't usually get in technical classes. The technical goal of this course is very practical in nature. You will have a \"working knowledge\" of these systems (some more than others). I will try to make this experience as practical as possible, using what I know about systems currently in place in both business and education, so that when you are done, you can honestly say you have some useful networking knowledge and experience. I know this is never fun, but here's what I have in mind at this point. There will probably be weekly or bi-weekly homework assignments that will be graded and represent 15-25% of the course grade. The labs will probably not be graded, since the goal is use and hands-on experience. However, what you do in the labs will appear on the exams or homework, or both, so you'll still have to learn this stuff. In other words, even though the last exam won't be a final, it's unlikely you'll pass it unless you've done well on the previous exams, labs and homework. In response to the demand for this course, at this time it appears it will be offered every semester. At this time, two sections of this course will be offered during Spring 1997.
