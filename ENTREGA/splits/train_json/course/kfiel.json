    "Cuerpo": "Course Description: A seminar in which the impact of computer technology, information systems in society and the associated ethical questions are written about and discussed. All reading assignments should be completed before the class period in which the assignment is to be discussed. This will be a prudent practice since a major part of your grade will be based on participation in seminar discussions. It is possible for everyone in the class to get an 'A' grade. These papers will indicate what you discovered in the reading assignment or within your self as illuminated by the reading assignment. Be sure to list the number of your paper using the period #'s in the day of the week column in the class schedule. These papers will be handed in at each seminar. Come to seminar prepared to discuss your discovery paper and/or the reading assignment. Regular seminar meeting times will be used to discuss concepts and insights from your discovery papers for each day's reading assignment. The major variable in the determination of grade in this seminar will be the score you assign yourself for your participation in the discussion. Participation in the discussions will be self graded each day and the score for the day's discussion will be handed in each period - according to the following scale: [ '0' reading assignment not competed - did not participate in discussion. '3' reading assignment completed and a significant contribution to the discussion that relates to the reading assignment.] From this grade scale you can see that your grade is heavily impacted by whether you have read the reading assignment each day. The major writing assignment, which is a report of the development and justification of your own personal professional code of ethics after the pattern of the ACM Code of Ethics. This paper may be handed in for a preliminary grade on or any time prior to period # 20. The turning in of papers for preliminary grade is optional. Writing three summary papers is required as shown in the schedule. These summary papers will address a set of questions that will relate to approximately the prior one third of the reading assignments. If you find it necessary to be absent, be sure to negotiate with me for a grade better than the '0','0' which you will receive for the discussion paper and discussion score if you miss the discussion and don't hand in the discussion paper. The late penalty for either summary papers or the code of ethics paper will be 20% for each day late.",
