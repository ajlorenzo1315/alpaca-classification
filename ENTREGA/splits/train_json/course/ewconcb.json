    "Cuerpo": "Emphasis on general techniques and approaches used for developing fast and efficient parallel algorithms and on limitations to their efficacy. Prerequisite: CSE 521 (or equivalent). CSE Majors only. Homework Assignments and Notes Syllabus Homework 1 Due Thursday, April 6. Due Thursday, April 20. Homework 3 Due Tuesday, May 2. Certified Write-All Paper .ps or .dvi This implies the existence of a more efficient consensus algorithm based upon swap - although it is not likely something you are going to see inside your next supercomputer. Homework 5 Due Thursday, May 25. Asynchronous P-RAM references - Martel et al. FOCS 1990, and Buss et al. (Manuscript) . Notes on memory models . A more descriptive title for this year's course would be: A theory of shared memory parallel computing, or maybe, topics in the theory of SMPC. The course will start with a collection of basic algorithms, and then we will spend some time on models of computation. The syllabus gives a list of topics which could be covered. My use of the term \"shared memory\" is to indicate that we will not be looking at topics which pertain to specific interconnection topologies. The course will be a theory course in the sense that we will not consider particular real machines, we will prove some theorems, and you will not be expected to log on to a parallel machine. Our goal in developing parallel algorithms will be to come up with algorithms which could conceivably be efficient on some parallel machines. The text for the course will be \"An Introduction to Parallel Algorithms\" by Ja Ja. This is a nice book, although I will not be following it very closely. My original plan, when I volunteered to teach the course a year ago, was that the text would be \"A Theory of Shared Memory Parallel Computing\" by Anderson. There is also a choice as to teach this course as either a traditional lecture course, or to work in some research content.",
