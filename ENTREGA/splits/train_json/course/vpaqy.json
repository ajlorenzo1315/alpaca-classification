    "Cuerpo": "This course is intended for students who received little or no programming instruction in high school. This section is taught entirely in the FORTRAN programming language and is intended primarily for engineering students and non-computer science majors.

You will only get the most out of this class if you read the relevant sections of the text before coming to class. This way you will be able to ask questions in class about anything that you are unsure of, instead of waiting until you're in the lab trying to work on an assignment to discover you didn't really understand something. Important - the on-line lecture notes are not a substitute for coming to class. Gradesheets What to do in DOS/Fortran (and how to hand in assignments online) Late Policy Policy on Academic Misconduct (i.e. cheating) Assignment Specifications: Program0 , due Friday 11/1/96, 5:00pm Program1 , due Wednesday 11/13/96, 5:00pm How to Get Help with Your Assignments: Consultants: The consultants in the computer lab can help you with most problems. I am not normally in my office except during office hours because I do my research from home via a modem. You can most easily contact me by E-mail because I regularly login and read my E-mail from home. If you mail from Netscape, make sure to include your name and e-mail address , as they don't show up for me, so I won't know who mailed me and be able to respond otherwise. Click here to send me E-mail. Problem Solving Exercises One of the most important skills you will learn in this class is problem solving . Good problem solving skills distinguish a \"good\" computer programmer from a \"bad\" one - it doesn't matter how familiar or skilled you are in a particular programming language, if you do not understand how to solve the problem then you will not be able to write a computer program for it in any language. You should look at the problem and think about it during the week and right down the steps you would go through to solve the problem; i.e. the overall structure of your program. This is primarily an exercise in general problem solving so you do not have to write any FORTRAN code (though you may if you want to and have time) and your solution/algorithm should not even be dependent on a particular programming language such as FORTRAN. Exercises: Computer Lab You will be using the Vectra lab in Rm. Once you exceed that quota you must contact the lab either by e-mail or by going to room 2310 during office hours (they prefer e-mail) to pay to increase your quota. You may also work in any of the other computer labs on campus, however most do not have FORTRAN compilers (please see me first before using the CAE lab ).",
