I spend most of my evenings attempting to earn a Ph.D. from the same place. Publications Vita Contacting Me Academic Interests My interests are related to presenting information to the user. I am particularly interested in presenting both detail and context in a single, integrated image using non-linear transformations. I have focused my efforts on presenting images of graphs - there are a couple of tech reports and a paper in my publications directory detailing this work.
