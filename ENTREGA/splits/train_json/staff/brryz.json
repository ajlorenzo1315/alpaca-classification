I am involved with two of the major systems projects at the Cornell Computer Science Department: The Horus and the Cornell ATM Cluster Projects. I think my research interests are best described by: Low latency and high bandwith communication support for highly reliable distributed systems with real time requirments. I focus on the system design and engineering issues. Some of the things I am working on: A highly predictable execution environment for Horus. The integration of Horus with some Real-Time environments needs to lead to a situation where we can reason about advanced operational guarantees. Low latency for all messages and high bandwidth with small messages are two issues that have fallen behind in the software design for high-speed network adapters. High-speed Cluster Communication protocols. Methods for dealing with guarantee failures (aka missed deadline support ). It is not bad to not be able to meet the guarantes you gave, it is bad to not tell anyone about it. If we want to take our distributed systems to a global scope, there is a need to find a generic mechanism to support failure suspision, detection and management of processes, nodes and networks. From our experience with group systems we can extract a mechanism that will work with any middleware package, regardless of its functionality. Horus is the brainchild of Robbert van Renesse and Ken Birman . The ATM Cluster work is done cooperation with Thorsten von Eicken and the Multimedia & Video-On-Demand Horus experiments are in concert with Brian Smith . I am responsible for CS 515 , a Practicum in Distributed Systems , and teach a number of lectures on network protocols and high-speed network technology in CS 514 : Practical Distributed Systems .
