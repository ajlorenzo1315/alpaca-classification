This work will allow a scientist to specify the differential equations to be studied, the mathematical techniques that will be used perform the numerical computations and the architecture of the machine on which the calculations will be done. With colleagues in the department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, this toolkit has been used to generate the dynamical systems that arise in the study of the boundary layers in fluids. The introduction of these new objects into a programming language provides a number of new challenges to the language's type system and provides new opportunities for deductive reasoning, which we are pursuing.
