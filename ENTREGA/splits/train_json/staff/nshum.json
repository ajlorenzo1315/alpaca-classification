Liebrock, Ph. D. Assoc. (1982), Delta Community College B.S. (1992), Ph.D. (1994), Rice University Lorie Liebrock's research interests are in using problem topology during compilation. In particular, the use of topology to automate data distribution and to allow application of regular application optimizations to partially regular problems. composite grid or multiblock) problems, e.g., aircraft aerodynamics and water-cooled nuclear reactor simulations, via the use of problem topology. For use with these automatic distribution algorithms, she has developed a program template and a set of style guidelines for these applications that allow automatic transformation of an application code with no notion of data distribution into a standard High Performance Fortran program with complete distribution specification.
