I work in the Department of Computer Science , helping keep our computing facilities running. In real life I am a parent, spouse, writer, struggling Catholic, volunteer, post trans sexual queer , and am generally involved in far too many things, as ENFP personalities often are. (But I am an inner-directed ENFP, which confuses the heck out of a lot of people.) A few of my favorite links My resume , and some mundane essays Religion is very important to me DOMA doesn't defend my marriage! Transgender issues and information Campus Lesbian-Bi-Gay and/or Trans support Photos: me with my brother, my kids , and a link to their mother 's page. Peace be with you! Lisa Lees / lisa@bellona.cps.msu.edu \"It seems a simple lesson, even trite. But passing never works, the lie always distances you from those who aren't party to it. Society may reward the lie, may even demand it, but the passing person is punished for passing--either by being caught in the lie or by believing it. Every closet is a prison, whether it is a construct of sex or of class. Passing kills, it annihilates who we are. And keeps us from who we could be.\" (Victoria A.
