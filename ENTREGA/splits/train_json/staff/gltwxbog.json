    "Cuerpo": "Call me bolo ... everyone, including my parents,  does! I've been doing that for the last 5 years. Before that, I was a BSD Kernel Hacker and Unix system Administrator. I create things, and that's why I'm an engineer . An engineer applies science to the design and construction of \"things\", and that's what I do. You can't really call me a scientist, though I have a Computer Sciences degree. The guy who pays me, David DeWitt , (who is a scientist) shudders at my methodology. On the other hand, I'm right most of the time. When I'm not designing, architecting,  and implementing new operating system type things, I'm often doing the same to other things. The address of my new place is Josef T. Burger 6301 East Gate Road Monona, WI  53716-3910 The new voice number is 608-223-0486 . It used to be fun, but now it's a grunge. I'm currently working on the following projects for Dave DeWitt , a world- (in)famous database hacker! All this, and a whole lot more , occurs at the Computer Sciences Department of the Madison Campus of the University of Wisconsin . Not so boring work In addition to my work for the UW, I also consult. I'd tell you to visit my web server but I haven't had time to do anything there, so it's mostly empty, except for the home pages of some friends. Along the same lines, I am also the Computer Sciences Department's volunteer news master. I don't have much time to take care of that software. Over the years we've developed new acquaintances, and many of them became part of our loftily-labelled Blitz Drinking Society . We meet once a year at the Essen Haus during the time of Octoberfest to have a weekend of fun. Bolo's Home Page Last modified: Tue Apr  2 23:31:48 CST 1996 Bolo (Josef Burger) <bolo@cs.wisc.edu>",
