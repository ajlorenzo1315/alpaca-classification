Large masses of machine-readable text now exist that can be cheaply stored on high-density optical storage media and rapidly retrieved on demand. In the absence of knowledge bases that would be useful for unrestricted text databases, we use corpus-based text analysis systems that determine the meaning of words and expressions by a refined context analysis using statistical and probabilistic criteria. Using the corpus-based approaches, we are able to determine text similarity with a high degree of accuracy. The automatic retrieval of interesting text excerpts in response to available search queries. In addition, we are also processing the TREC collection consisting of about 800,000 full-text documents covering a number of different subject areas (over 2 gigabytes of text). The main test vehicle continues to be the current version of the Smart text analysis and retrieval system, operating under UNIX on Sun Sparc Stations and Sun-4 terminal equipment.
