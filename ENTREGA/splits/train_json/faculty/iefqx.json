    "Cuerpo": "In contrast to other commercial and research approaches, which require specialized hardware, operating systems, or networks to be usable, all of these technologies we are designing fit into the current research environment. Our premise is that the current hardware, software, and communication infrastructure is sufficient to support research into continuous media systems and applications. Our research on storage systems is directed towards building the Zeno distributed video file server. The Zeno architecture uses a network of workstations connected by a generic local area network (e.g., an ethernet), a common environment in computing research laboratories. As a client, a workstation plays video stored on one or more servers. As a server, a workstation is a file server for video data. The load generated by serving videos is distributed both across machines and across networks (in the case where the servers are located on different networks). Low initial investment. Cyclic-UDP is used by the Zeno file server to deliver audio and video data to clients. First, we are developing algorithms to process video data in the compressed representation. We are currently extending these ideas by parallelizing the algorithms using networks of workstations and by developing a method for transcoding video in software. Our research on video processing is also exploring methods to simplify experimentation with video processing by developing a programming language where video is a first class data type. A talk that reviews our research on video processing, both compressed domain processing and Rivl, is available online. A talk that reviews this research is also available online.
