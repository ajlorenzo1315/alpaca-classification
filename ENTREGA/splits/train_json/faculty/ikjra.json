    "Cuerpo": "Our major experimentation is with Nuprl , a 60,000-line Lisp program that implements a constructive theory of types. Systems such as Nuprl are useful formalizations of mathematics because they can express a wide variety of proof and program-building methods as metalevel programs of the system. In principle, Nuprl is both a fomal system of mathematics and a programming language. We continue to improve Nuprl; the current version used at Cornell is called Nuprl 4. It differs from its predecessors in having a new term editor designed by Stuart Allen and implemented by Richard Eaton. Its internal structure is more modular, making the system suitable for he definition of a wide variety of logics beyond the built-in constructive type theory. Finally, this version of the system can refer to itself. Richard Eaton designed a link between the internal description of the logic and the logic itself, which makes it possible to prove theorems about the process of proving theorems. We are also engaged in three exciting joint ventures. One is with Miriam Leeser of Electrical ENgineering and the other two are in Computer Science; with David Gries on Polya and with Richard Zippel on Weyl . The second joint venture involves building a model of the Polya programming language and a program refinement mechanism for it, both designed by David Gries, which will enable him to write his handbook of algorithms in the manner that he devised through years of study of the programming process. We have been discussing problems with Richard Zippel and are hoping to connect Zippel's symbolic algebra system, Weyl, with Nuprl in the near future. This will be used to explore the development of scientific computing software using Weyl and Nuprl together with other tools that Zippel is building.
