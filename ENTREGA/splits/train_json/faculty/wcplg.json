Caltech Infospheres Project Projects in formal methods and practical applications in distributed information, collaboration over the Web, Java, and the Internet. Compositional C++ A parallel programming language based on C++. Compositional Systems Research Group of the Center for Research on Parallel Computation Projects in formal methods and practical applications in compositional systems, distributed computing, CORBA, SDL, Multicast, Opendoc, and UNITY. Infosphere Infrastructure Research Project A distributed programming layer using the Web, Java, and the Internet. Problem Solving Environments Specially suited environments to enable scientists to solve complex problems. Current Students at Caltech Joe Kiniry Berna Massingill Adam Rifkin Paul A. G. Sivilotti Eve Schooler Dan Zimmerman Former Students at Caltech Ulla Binau (PhD, 1993) Peter Carlin (BS/MS, 1994-95) Peter Hofstee (PhD, 1994) Rohit Khare (BS, 1995) Svetlana Kryukova (BS/MS, 1995) K. Rustan M. Leino (PhD, 1995) Rajit Manohar (MS, 1994) John Thornley (PhD, 1996) Courses at Caltech CS 138abc. 9 units (3-0-6); not offered 1996-97. Design, analysis, and proofs of correctness of computer programs. NP-completeness. Models of parallel, concurrent, and distributed computation. Searching, sorting, string matching. Heuristic search. Algorithms for distributed systems. CS 141abc. 9 units (3-3-3); prerequisites: CS138 or equivalent. This laboratory course deals with applications of systematic design methods and theories for reasoning about the correctness and performance of concurrent programs. The first two terms require program development carried out individually or in groups of two, and the third term has a larger project carried out by a team. Aspects of communication protocols for static and mobile systems, distributed operating systems, and fault-tolerant systems are studied with a focus on systematic design to achieve reliability and performance.",
