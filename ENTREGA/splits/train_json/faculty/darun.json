    "Cuerpo": "Welcome to my home page. Some information about me: I am an assistant professor of Computer Science at Wellesley College, (about 10 miles from downtown Boston. ) I studied Mathematics in the University of Athens before coming to the U.S. to study Computer Science at Brown University in 1985. I graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Dartmouth College in 1992. If you want to send me email, click here or use address pmetaxas@wellesley.edu. You can find me at building NE43-313, call me at (617)253-7843 or send me email at takis@theory.lcs.mit.edu Interests When I am not meditating with my daughter, Danae, I am interested in  Parallel Computing, Multimedia and Algorithm Visualization, and Computer Science Education. Specifically: Parallel Graph and Combinatorial Algorithms, Computing Issues of Parallel Machines, Parallel Algorithmic Techniques and Paradigms, Architecture-Specific Parallel Algorithms and Implementation, Realizable Models of Parallel and Distributed Computation, Human-Computer Interfaces for Cultural and Educatonal Multimedia, Development of Tools for Visualizing Sequential and Parallel Algorithms, CS Curriculum Development, Teaching Methods and Tools. I am a member of ACM and SIGACT 's electronic publication board and of DAGS steering committee. I am also an editor of the electronic Journal of Universal Computer Science (J.UCS), published by Springer-Verlag. I also maintain the Dartmouth CS Alumni home page Publications A partial list of my technical reports appears at the Dartmouth CS abstracts pool. A couple of hypercard animations for connected components and updating minimum spanning trees (encoded in hexadecimal) are ftp-able. Read the README file for more information on the animations.

Lectures on Data-Parallel Computing On-line support of the CD-ROM. 1996 World Conference on Educational Multimedia and Hypermedia, Boston, MA Some Greek WebPages Greek Village Hellenic Resources Institute ***** OUR WEB PAGE RECEIVES 5 STARS 5 STARS AWARD: Following the trend that assigns stars to Web pages, we are happy to announce that our web page has received 5 stars by the author's daughter, Danae. \", Danae showed without hesitation the five fingers of her right hand. (Those not familiar with the Greek Culture, may want to ask a Greek friend to fully appreciate the award.) It should be noted that, unlike all the other star-awarding organizations, Danae does not sell anything (at least for the moment). Back to the CS home page.
