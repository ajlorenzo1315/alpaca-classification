    "Cuerpo": "The Hebrew University  Computer Science 1990  M.Sc. Currently, I am building the Distributed Systems and Communication lab at the Department of Computer Science here at Hopkins, and also am affiliated with the Center of Excellence in Space Data and Information Sciences (CESDIS) , The Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA. We are just strating, so it is not too late to join! And guess what: I even got a PhD for that :) I was one of the initiators and main participants of the Transis project with Professor Danny Dolev at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel. Transis is a group communication tool that supports reliable multicast services over a partitioned network. I also took part in building the Totem group communication protocol with Professors Melliar-Smith and Moser at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
