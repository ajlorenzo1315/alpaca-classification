    "Cuerpo": "The input is a set of images or video streams, acquired from fixed or mobile cameras around a site, and the output is a panoramic visualization of the scene in which a virtual, user-controlled camera can be moved through the environment. The main research question is how to adaptively combine a set of basis images to synthesize new views of the scene without 3D models or 3D scene reconstruction as an intermediate step. Recently we have developed an innovative technique, which we call view morphing , that takes two basis images and interpolates a continuous range of in-between images corresponding to views on the linear path connecting the two camera centers. We have been studying how to purposefully control the position and orientation of a camera in order to dynamically adjust viewpoint based on the appearance of a three-dimensional scene. By coordinating simple observer behaviors that change the appearance of surfaces in a well-defined way, we simplify the image computations required, make precise the global progress of an algorithm, and eliminate the need for accurate differential measurements of the camera motion. We have used this approach to develop provably-correct algorithms for (1) moving to a side view of a surface of revolution in order to recover its shape, and (2) reconstructing the global surface of an unknown smooth, arbitrarily-shaped object. Visualization In the area of visualization we have developed mapping techniques capable of generating displays of all possible data objects defined in a user's algorithm, without the need for user-defined, type-specific graphics display procedures.
