    "Cuerpo": "He is affiliated with the Computer Vision Laboratory of the Center for Automation Research, for which he served as the head from 1981-1986. This NSF funded Grand Challenge project focuses on the use of high performance computing for addressing problems in analysis of remotely sensed images. New algorithms and data structures for image classification, mixture modeling and map and image databases are being developed as part of this program. Visual navigation . Research at Maryland focuses on image stabilization and estimation of egomotion from time varying images. Additionally, we have studied the use of radial basis function neural networks for road navigation. This research focuses on the analysis of time varying images of humans to recognize facial expressions as well as other facial actions (blinking, head gestures, etc.) To view a movie illustrating this research, click video clip (1.9 MB) . Looking at people in action. We are investigating the problem of recognizing natural human activities (e.g., types of calisthetic exercises) based on multi-camera time varying image analysis. A small database of nine views of a human performing two types of activities was acquired at Carnegie Mellon University, and we are currently attempting to develop algorithms for reconstructing the sequence of instantaneous configurations of the human based on integration of analysis from these nine views over time. More recent work investigates the problem of finding and tracking people in both IR and color video, and recognizing their interactions with one another and with objects in their environments. This is an NSF grant that provided funds for the acquisition of two high performance computers for the UMIACS/CSD high performance computing laboratory. The two machines acquired are a 16 node IBM SP2 (to be configured as a machine for I/O research with over 250GB of disk and a tertiary storage system) and a 10 node Alpha workstation farm.
