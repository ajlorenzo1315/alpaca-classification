Joy Shetler Associate Professor Computer Engineering Program B.S., Electronic Engineering (Honors), Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo M.S., Ph.D., Electrical And Computer Engineering, UC Santa Barbara Office: 20-213 Phone: 805/756-2309 Email: jshetler@phoenix.csc.calpoly.edu Biography: Professor Shetler's research interests are in computer architecture and design. In June 1996, she received a CAREER grant from the National Science Foundation to establish an active research effort in microelectronic systems architecture that enhances the undergraduate curriculum in Computer Engineering, Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, and introduces students to new computer architectures, new technology and microelectronic systems. The focus of the research component is to devise and test Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP) techniques and mechanisms. Part of this project involves developing a rapid-prototyping platform. Her industrial experience includes computer design at Burroughs Corp. (now UNISYS) for four years and at Trilogy Systems of Cupertino (now defunct). At Burroughs, she was a designer of the A9/A10 mainframe. Compcon Dr. Shetler is currently serving on the steering committee for Compcon 97. Only the information for those courses is valid. Information on other courses she has taught may not be up to date. Computer Architecture II CPE 315 This course covers computer architecture and microprogramming. Computer Architecture III CPE 316 This course covers computer architecture and interfacing techniques. The emphasis is on interfacing at the system bus level using asynchronous and synchronous protocols. Memory addressing strategies and memory mapped I/O are also covered. Digital Systems Design CPE 319 This course covers the design of digital systems using combinational and sequential circuits. The course covers current implementation strategies including the use of PLDs and FPGAs. Microprocessor Systems Design CPE X436 This course covers microprocessor systems design. Research Interests: multithreaded processor designs description FPGA implementations description and more description Recent & Current Master Theses students: Reggie Hunt - June 1996 - The Design and Implementation of An Object-Based, Interrupt Driven Operating System Mike Griffin - June 1996 - The Design and Implementation of An Object-Based, Interrupt Driven Operating System Jeff Bain - June 1996 - Design and Analysis of Instruction Issue Logic Ed Stoebner - In progress Chia Yang - In progress Recent Senior Projects Completed: Dale Wills - June 1995 - Automobile Racetrack Display using an MC68HC11 Heidi Rylance - December 1995 - Implementation of the PowerPC's Instruction Queue Using Schematic Capture and FPGAs Brandon Blodget - December 1995 - Implementation of the PowerPC's Instruction Queue Using Schematic Capture and FPGAs Charles DeCraene - March 1996 - MC68000 Based Small Computer Senior Projects in Progress: Please note that these are preliminary topics and may change slightly!
