As part of the Wisconsin Wind Tunnel ( WWT ) Project, I have helped develop a hybrid (software-hardware), shared-memory computer architecture that facilitates programming and compiling for parallel machines. I'm also interested performance evaluation tools that help programmers understand and improve their programs' performance.",
