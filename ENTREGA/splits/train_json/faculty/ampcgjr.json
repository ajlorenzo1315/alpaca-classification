Fundamentally, the role of an operating system is to abstract the physical resources of the underlying hardware, and to multiplex these resources among multiple application programs and users. On the one hand, operating systems are expected to efficiently support a broad range of application programs, including scientific, engineering, business, and entertainment applications. On the other hand, a single operating system is expected to efficiently run on a wide range of computer systems, ranging from PDAs and personal computers to parallel supercomputers, all connnected by networks with widely differing performance characteristics. Peter's long-term research goal is to develop an operating system that can be configured to run on radically different distributed hardware platforms, and whose services can be dynamically customized and extended to efficiently support specific applications. Towards this end, his research focuses on two issues: Communications-oriented OS design Current operating systems are well suited for applications that spend most of their time operating on data stored in main memory, and that perform occasional, coarse-grained I/O operations on slow devices. To satisfy modern distributed applications that perform frequent, fine-grained I/O on fast devices, operating systems must (1) minimize kernel involvement in common case I/O operations, and (2) tightly manage system resources to maintain fairness and quality of service. We investigate customizable operating system services that allow applications to tailor service implementations so that they meet precisely their needs in functionality and performance.
