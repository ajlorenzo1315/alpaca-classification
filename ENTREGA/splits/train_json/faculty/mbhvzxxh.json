    "Cuerpo": "We have developed two test environments that allow the non-sighted user to navigate through complex menu structures and the visual desktop with the aid of musical tones and synthesized voice. The test environments currently run on Macs in the CS Department's labs. We are always looking for volunteers to test the intefaces concepts. Navigating Hierarchical Menu Structures Using Tonal Clues Navigating The DeskTop Using Sound and Voice Using PDAs in the Health Care Setting If you are interested in participating in any of the experiments, please click here to send me an email message.
