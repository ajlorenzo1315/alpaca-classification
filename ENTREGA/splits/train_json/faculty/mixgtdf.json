The Operating Systems research lab and the Distributed Systems research laboratory. We house 12 IBM PS/2 computers that run Mirage+, 9 Dec Alpha AXP computers, a Macintosh, and a Sun. Specifically, Computer Marketplace Inc has provided 6 RS6000 machines for a research cluster we are designing. We also will obtain 5 PowerPC computers from IBM that will be used for research and instruction. Both Systems Laboratories are used to design, implement, and measure the performance of operating systems, distributed systems,and to study DSM. Our group works on UNIX, AIX, HP-UX, DEC UNIX, OSF/1, Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups, Windows-NT, Lynx, SunOS, and Solaris.

STUDENT THESIS' Here are thesis' by students that I have supervised. Thesis, June 1996, 172 pages. Fine coffee should be savored and certainly no fake powdered milk should be used in it. I am currently searching for a machine of equivalent functionality for the day my one remaining machine dies.",
