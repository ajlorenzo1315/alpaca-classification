    "Cuerpo": "It offers low-latency and high-bandwidth communication over high-speed LANs. The current implementation uses Sun Workstations interconnected by ATM. Several projects are porting Active Messages to new platforms (including the U-Net ATM cluster and the IBM SP-2 and extending the model to non-SPMD programs.
