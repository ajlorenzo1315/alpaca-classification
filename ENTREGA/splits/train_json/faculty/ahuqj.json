Bansal Up: Computer Science Faculty Next: S teve Chapin Kenneth Batcher Professor Dr. Batcher received a B.S.E.E. degree from Iowa State University in 1957 and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Illinois in 1962 and 1964, respectively. He worked in the Computer Engineering Department of Goodyear Aerospace Corporation (later Loral Defense Systems Division, now Lockheed-Martin Tactical Defense Systems Division) for 28 years where he developed the architectures of two SIMD parallel processors: the STARAN (1972) and the MPP (1983). He discovered two parallel sorting algorithms: the odd-even mergesort and the bitonic mergesort. In 1990, Dr. Batcher was awarded the Eckert-Mauchly Award from the ACM and the IEEE Computer Society \"for the pioneering implementation of parallel computers and for contributions to interconnection network theory.\" He is a Fellow in the ACM and a member of SIGARCH.
