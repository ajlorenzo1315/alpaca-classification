    "Cuerpo": "My research primarily focuses on two areas of database systems: optimization of complex queries and database support for scientific data. The number of alternative evaluation algorithms will be much higher as well, especially with the use of parallelism or with attempts to optimize for several values of run-time parameters (parametric query optimization). Error propagation of size and cost estimates in complex queries are also part of my studies, where I am trying to identify the appropriate information that must be maintained by a database system to limit the propagation of error. To that end, I'm primarily focusing on identifying the properties of optimal histograms that approximate the distribution of values in relation attributes. The computational mode of investigation is expected to be part of many experiments in various scientific disciplines in the future. I am involved in the development of the {\\it ZOO Desktop Experiment Management Environment} that will help scientists throughout the life cycle of their experimental studies. In the former, I'm concentrating on identifying what the right metaphors are for representing complex database schemas, queries, and objects to scientists so that they are natural to them, and also on investigating the power of {\\it dynamic visual queries} In the latter, I'm concentrating on developing visual tools that will facilitate translation and integration of different data formats or schemas. 3, September 1995, pp. R.
