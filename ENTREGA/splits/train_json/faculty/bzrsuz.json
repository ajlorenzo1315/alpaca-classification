Grosz DIVISION OF ENGINEERING AND APPLIED SCIENCES HARVARD UNIVERSITY Barbara J. Grosz Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science Artificial Intelligence Professor Grosz's research in artificial intelligence deals with problems in natural-language processing and collaborative planning. Her current work encompasses: computational theories of discourse and discourse processing, computational models of collaborative planning, investigations of the interactions between intonation and discourse, and the development of collaborative, multimedia systems for human-computer communication. Professor Grosz has developed a theory of discourse structure that specifies how discourse interpretation depends on interactions among speaker intentions, attentional state, and linguistic form. With colleagues at AT&T Bell Laboratories, she is using the theory to study the information about discourse structure conveyed by intonation, i.e., how tones demark, in spoken language, some of the structure that paragraphs and parentheses indicate in written language. In addition, Professor Grosz is also involved in an interdisciplinary investigation of the connections between centering of attention and form of reference. Professor Grosz is also working on a theory of collaboration to support the construction of intelligent computer \"agents\" that work together in teams. This theory also provides a basis for modeling the intentional component of discourse structure. Babara Grosz and Yael Ziv. In Walker, Joshi, and Prince, eds., Centering in Discourse .
