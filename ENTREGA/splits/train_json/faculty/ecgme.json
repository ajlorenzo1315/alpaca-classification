    "Cuerpo": "This project involves extending ATM switches to assist in the provision of end-to-end reliable multicast in which the amount of work that must be done by senders and receivers is essentially independent of the size of the multicast. A second mechanism allows multiple senders on a many-to-many multicast to send multi-cell packets on a single virtual circuit without losing the ability to properly demultiplex them at the receiver. This is done using a dynamic virtual circuit subchannel mechanism . Gigabit ATM Switching. This work is part of a major ARPA-funded project on gigabit network technology . ATM Network Design . Network design methods that allow network managers to define traffic requirements at a fairly gross level and adopt a worst-case approach to network design appear to be more appropriate. Distributed Control of ATM Networks The design of ATM switching hardware is now fairly well-understood. We are developing a framework for precisely defining and analyzing network control systems that allows the essential issues to be separated from the welter of protocol and implementation details that often make it difficult to make meaningful comparisons [ TU95b ] and using this framework to develop precise characterizations of new approaches to distributed network control [ WU95 ]. In addition, we have designed and are implementing a particular network control system details of which can be found in Project Ideas Here is a list of project ideas for graduate students. Multistage switching networks are among the simplest and most cost-effective architectures for large ATM switching systems. This work extends the classical theory of nonblocking networks to apply to switching systems supporting communication channels with different rates that can share the capacity of both external links and internal switch data paths. We are interested in both worst-case analysis and probabilistic analysis. Andy Fingerhut , DSc (CS), `` Approximation Algorithms for Configuring Nonblocking Communication Networks ,'' 5/94.
