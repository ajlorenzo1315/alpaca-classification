    "Cuerpo": "While at Goodyear, he was involved in software development for the STARAN, ASPRO and MPP SIMD computers. While at the Supercomputing Research Center, he performed research on the Connection Machine for 1 and  1/2 years. His research interests include the continuing development of the associative computing paradigm, the integration of associative SIMD computers with other architectures in a heterogeneous supercomputer environment, the development of techniques for compilation on massively parallel SIMD computers, natural language and artificial intelligence processing on SIMD computers, and the development of techniques for the introduction of parallel programming at the high school level. Selected Research Accomplishments Over the last 5 years, Dr.  Potter has developed and implemented the ``Associative Computing Paradigm\" as a general purpose approach to parallel computing. He has recently published a ``Frontiers of Computer Science\" research monograph ``ASSOCIATIVE COMPUTING'' (Plenum Publishers, February 1992) on his work in associative computing. He was awarded an ``Ohio Innovator Award\" in 1987 for his research on parallel OPS5 and associative computing. He is also an area editor for the Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing. He has had support from NOSC and NASA for the investigation of Heterogeneous Associative Computing. C.
