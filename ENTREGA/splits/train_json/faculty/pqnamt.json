Contents Research Summary Preprints and Manuscripts Selected Publications Postdoctoral Position Available Courses Cognitive AI I: Reasoning Machine Learning How to contact me Research Summary My research focuses on developing and testing theories of how people acquire and process language. To carry out such an analysis for a particular linguistic task, one must: Make a hypothesis about the sources of information people use to perform the task. Work out a formula for the way in which information of this type affects the probabilities of various linguistic analyses, according to normative rules of conditional probability. This yields a mathematical hypothesis at Marr's computational level about the implications of the information source for the linguistic task. Develop an algorithm by which the language processor could evaluate various linguistic analyses, according to the formula. \"Advances in the Computational Study of Language Acquisition.\" Cognition, volume 61.
