Java for Wavelets Java is still a bit painful, but it provides extraordinary potential for use in research and teaching. Check them out! A simple demonstration of how to draw smooth curves through corner cutting (and my first attempt at Java...). This is an instance of subdivision which is intricately linked to wavelet constructions. It demonstrates B-splines and Bezier curves of varying order and lenght all rolled into one application. AWESOME! Wim Sweldens wrote a little applet that allows you to explore the space of all four tap wavelets . Watch this space for more to come as Mike Astle and Dae Kang start hacking Java this summer! News I was just named a Sloan Foundation Fellow ( Caltech Press Release ) and an NSF National Young Investigator to work on `` Wavelet Methods: Connecting Theory and Application .'' Current Activities Co-Chair of the 7th Eurographics Rendering Workshop , June 17-19th, Porto, Portugal Program committee member, 1996 Symposium on Volume Visualization , October 27-28, 1996, San Francisco Co-Organizer with Wim Sweldens of the 1996 Siggraph course on Wavelets in Computer Graphics Program committee member, 1997 ACM Symposium on 3D Interactive Graphics Member of the special study group of the International Association of Geodesy on Wavelets Contact Info Department of Computer Science, 256-80 1201 E. California Blvd., MS 256-80 California Institute of Technology Pasadena, CA 91125 Fax: 818.792.4257 Vox: 818.395.4269 Net: ps@cs.caltech.edu Office: 286 Jorgensen Classes Topics in Geometric Modeling (CS 274b, winter quarter, 1996) 3D Photography (CS 274c, EE/CNS 148, spring quarter, 1996) Research Interests My main interest right now is in multi level methods . So far this has been happening under the headline of wavelets , but we are generalizing the ideas more and more, so whether it should still be called wavelets is up to debate. The first two chapters are the latest (and much improved...) guide to ``Building Your Own Wavelets at Home.'' Final Siggraph version and some cool pix: Mannequin , Tetrahedron , Pipes , and Venus (David coming soon...) Wavelets in Computer Graphics , to appear in a special issue of the Proceedings of the IEEE . Spherical Wavelets: Efficiently Representing Functions on the Sphere (with Wim Sweldens), appeared in Proceedings of Siggraph 95 . Spherical Wavelets: Texture Processing (with Wim Sweldens), appeared in Rendering Techniques `95 , Springer Verlag. Wavelet Image Compression appeared in Wired Magazine , 3.05, May 1995. Building Your Own Wavelets at Home (with Wim Sweldens), appeared as a TR . I have also contributed to the Siggraph notes for the Wavelets in Computer Graphics course held at Siggraph 95, Los Angeles.
