    "Cuerpo": "Typical applications are automated deduction and logic programming. In automated deduction, we use tools like resolution to prove new mathematical theorems. Specific topics I am considering are the Prolog use of negation-as-failure, and the semantic incompatibilities between least-fixed-point computations and the Prolog-style backtracking computation. In mathematical logic, I work on axiomatic set theory. Besides being of interest in its own right, this subject relates to various abstract areas of mathematics, such as set-theoretic topology and measure theory, where many basic questions turn out to be independent of the usual axioms of set theory.
