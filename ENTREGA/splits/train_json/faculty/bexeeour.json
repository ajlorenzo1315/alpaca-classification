He received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science  from Rutgers University in 1990 and 1993. He joined the Department of Computer Science at UCSB in 1993 as an Assistant Professor. Dr. Yang is a member of the Parallel Systems Group at UCSB. His main research interests are algorithms and programming environments for parallel and distributed processing, program scheduling and compilation,  and parallel scientific computing. He has proposed efficient scheduling algorithms and developed a parallel programming system for exploring task parallelism on message-passing machines, and applied this system in scientific computing. Dr. Yang is currently investigating the partitioning and scheduling methods and systems for program parallelization, irregular sparse matrix computations and WWW/digital libraries. Dr. Yang is a PC member and the tutorials chair for IPPS'97 (11th Inernational Parallel Processing Symposium) , a PC member and local organizer of Irregular'96 (Third International Workshop on Parallel Algorithms for Irregularly Structured Problems) , a PC member of Euro-Par'96 for Workshop #17 on Scheduling and Load Balancing , the Second Workshop on Solving Irregular Problems on Distributed Memory Machines in IPPS 96 , the 8th IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing in 1996, and the 3rd International Conference on High Performance Computing (HiPC) . He is a coordinator for minitrack \"Partitioning and Scheduling\" in the 28th and 29th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences. He is the local arrangements and registration co-chair for the ACM PPoPP (Symposium on Principle and Practice of Parallel Programming) and ACM SPAA (Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures) in 1995. Dr. Yang is  on the editorial boards of Journal Discrete Mathematics \\& Theoretical Computer Science and the Journal of Computing and Information, and a guest editor for a special issue on partitioning and scheduling in Journal Parallel Processing Letters. Dr. Yang received the Research Initiation Award from NSF in 1994, UC Regents' Junior Faculty Award in 1994 and the Outstanding Computer Science Professor of the Year Award in 1995.
