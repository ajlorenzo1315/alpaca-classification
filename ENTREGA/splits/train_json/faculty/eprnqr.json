But now I am specializing in parallel/distributed processing for Machine Learning (or alternatively click here) , Intelligent Information Systems , Knowledge Discovery in Databases and Data Mining , Financial Systems Computing, and Active Databases. I am a member of  the editorial board of the Journal on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery . Please take a look at our Call for Papers. See also the page on the Parallel and Distributed Intelligent Systems Lab for a more thorough treatment of my current research activities and relationship to industrial users. MERGE-PURGE: Intelligently Integrating Heterogenous Databases Although  the term merge/purge is used by our Citicorp collaborators and other commercial organizations, it is probably better termed The Data Scrubbing, or Data Cleaning Problem . The essential idea is to combine a number of separately learned classifiers or models in such a fashion that machine learning can be scaled to large (and inherently distributed) databases, and (ideally) accuracy can be boosted. Widely Distributed Data Mining and Fraud Detection My current interest lies in the future of large scale network-based information systems, especially Fraud and Intrusion Detection . (These problems probably occur today but no one has yet learned how to detect it globally! This research is being conducted in collaboration with our friends at the Financial Services Technology Consortium. So Phil Chan, David Wolpert and myself are organizing a Workshop at AAAI-96 called Integrating Multiple Models for Improving and Scaling Machine Learning. See the workshop agenda and call for papers . See the description on Fraud and Intrusion Detection in Financial Information Systems using Meta-learning Agents for details about our approach. Citicorp My relationship with Citicorp was established through my consultancies and research relationships with the Citicorp Technology Office. My collaboration with Citicorp and other organizations lead to the development of a number of fundamental technologies that were demonstrated in \"real-life\" financial applications. Their SOS agent infrastructure is being used in our work on meta-learning agents for fraud and intrusion detection. The Answer Did you guess what the image means? Some of you may even have heard of a special event in Ridgewood, New Jersey where we live. Visit the homepages of both for a peek at what's up in Ridgewood! And if you haven't figured out what I might look like well check this out too.",
