Schlichting Home Page Richard D. Schlichting Rick received the B.A. Since 1982, Rick has been in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Arizona , where he is currently holds the rank of Professor. His research interests include distributed systems, fault-tolerant computing, and heterogeneous scientific applications. Much of his current work in fault-tolerant computing involves using the x-kernel in various ways to support fault-tolerance, and is done in cooperation with members of the Network Systems Research Group . He currently supervises one postdoctoral associate ( Matti Hiltunen ), and four graduate students ( Nina Bhatti , Ilwoo Chang, Xiaonan Han, and Don Waugaman ). Rick is a member of ACM, IEEE, and the IFIP Working Group 10.4 on Dependable Computing and Fault-Tolerance . He is on the editorial boards of IEEE Transactions on Computers, IEEE Parallel and Distributed Technology, and the Springer-Verlag series on Dependable Computing and Fault-Tolerant Systems. He is also current Vice-Chair of the IEEE Technical Committee on Fault-Tolerant Computing, and has served on numerous conference program committees in the areas of fault tolerance and distributed computing. As part of his Japan activities, Rick heads the JapanCS Project , and is founder and current moderator of the USENET newsgroup comp.research.japan , an electronic forum devoted to Japanese research developments in computing and computer science. He is also a member of the Association of Research Libraries Working Group on Japanese Scientific and Technical Information. M. Suzuki, T. Katayama, and R.
