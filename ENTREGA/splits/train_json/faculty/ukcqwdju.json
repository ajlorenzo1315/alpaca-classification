The NLP group at Cornell is primarily interested in investigating the use of machine learning techniques as tools for guiding natural language system development and for exploring the mechanisms that underly language acquisition. Our work focuses on two related areas: (1) the design of user-trained systems that can efficiently and reliably extract the important information from a document, and (2) the machine learning of natural language. As part of Cornell's CSTR project, we are using information extraction techniques to support content-based browsing of technical texts. The focus of the Kenmore project is on developing techniques to automate the knowledge acquisition tasks that comprise the building of any NLP system. In all of our work, we evaluate the language learning components in the context of the larger NLP application in which it is embedded. The goal of the project is to determine the conditions under which machine learning techniques can be expected to offer a cost-effective approach to knowledge acquisition for NLP systems.
