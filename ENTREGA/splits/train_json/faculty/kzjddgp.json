    "Cuerpo": "I have been heavily involved in applying assertional reasoning to the design of concurrent, distributed, fault-tolerant, and real-time programs. Along with David Gries, I continue investigations concerning our first-order equational logic E. This past year, we streamlined the inference rules and evaluated a number of techniques for handling undefined terms and partial functions. Use of a hypervisor to implement replica coordination is attractive - at least, in theory. Second, when replica coordination is implemented in a hypervisor, a single implementation suffices for every operating system that executes on that instruction-set architecture. Finally, by implementing replica coordination in a hypervisor, the applications programmer is freed from this task. Jointly with Dag Johansen (University of Tromsø, Norway) and Robbert van Renesse, I started the TACOMA project (Tromsø And COrnell Moving Agents) to investigate support and use of mobile processes in building mission-critical applications. Two TACOMA prototypes have been completed, and we are implementing a third system based on our experiences.
