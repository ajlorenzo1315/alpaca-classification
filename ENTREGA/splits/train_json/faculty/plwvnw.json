I work on methodologies, paradigms, and algorithms for fault-tolerant distributed systems, in both message-passing and shared-memory  systems. My long-term goal is to bridge the gap between  theoretical results and the need for efficient and practical solutions. In collaboration with Tushar Chandra and Prasad Jayanti , two Ph.D. Computer Science students, we continued our work on unreliable failure detectors for message-passing systems , and on wait-free objects for shared-memory systems. A fundamental result of fault-tolerant distributed computing states that the Consensus problem cannot be solved (with a deterministic  algorithm) in asynchronous systems. We first  showed one can use W, an unreliable failure detector that can make an  infinite number of mistakes, to solve Consensus in systems with a  majority of correct processes. We then proved that to solve Consensus, any failure detector has to provide at least as much information about  failures as W.  Thus, W is the weakest failure detector for solving  Consensus in asynchronous systems with a majority of correct  processes. We are now exploring wait-free hierarchies of object types, where each object (type) is assigned to a level that corresponds to its  ability in implementing other wait-free objects.
