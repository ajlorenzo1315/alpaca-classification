This program is using a decision tree induction system implemented by S. Murthy at the Johns Hopkins University. Our main focus is the design and analysis of algorithms for high-performance intelligent systems. Specifically, we are interested in efficient parallel and sequential algorithms for modelling and controlling complex processes (e.g., computer systems or neural networks) -- intelligent information retrieval and modelling of large data depositories (that can be used in educational environments) -- constraint networks and probabilistic networks (that can be used for decision-making with uncertainty, e.g., medical diagnosis) -- and machine learning.
