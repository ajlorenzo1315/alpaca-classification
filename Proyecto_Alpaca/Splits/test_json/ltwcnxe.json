Mooney Proceedings of the Thirteenth National Conference on Aritificial Intelligence , pp. (AAAI-96) Most research in planning and learning has involved linear, state-based planners. This paper presents SCOPE, a system for learning search-control rules that improve the performance of a partial-order planner. SCOPE integrates explanation-based and inductive learning techniques to acquire control rules for a partial-order planner. Integrating EBL and ILP to Acquire Control Rules for Planning Tara A. Estlin and Raymond J. Mooney Proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Multi-Strategy Learning , pp. 271-279, Harpers Ferry, WV, May 1996. Most approaches to learning control information in planning systems use explanation-based learning to generate control rules. This paper presents a novel learning approach for control knowledge acquisition that integrates explanation-based learning with techniques from inductive logic programming. Integrating Explanation-Based and Inductive Learning Techniques to Acquire Search-Control for Planning Tara A. Estlin Ph.D. proposal, Department of Computer Sciences, University of Texas at Austin, 1996. Machine learning techniques enable a planning system to automatically acquire domain-specific search-control knowledge for different applications. This paper presents a novel learning approach for control knowledge acquisition that integrates explanation-based learning with techniques from inductive logic programming. In our learning system SCOPE, EBL is used to constrain an inductive search for control heuristics that help a planner choose between competing plan refinements. The resulting system is shown to produce significant speedup in two different planning domains, and to be more effective than a pure EBL approach. Future research will be performed in three main areas. Second, SCOPE will be more thoroughly tested; several real-world planning domains have been identified as possible testbeds, and more in-depth comparisons will be drawn between SCOPE and other competing approaches. Third, SCOPE will be implemented in a different planning system in order to test its portability to other planning algorithms. This paper presents results on applying a version of the DOLPHIN search-control learning system to speed up a partial-order planner. A version of the UCPOP partial-order planning algorithm has been implemented as a Prolog program and DOLPHIN used to automatically learn domain-specific search control rules that help eliminate backtracking. Second, planning systems must be able to fit into a wide range of operational contexts - most planning tasks cannot be completely automated, therefore at a minimum the plans produced must be easily understandable and modifiable by the users. Third, planning systems must be able to compare favorably in terms of software lifecycle costs to other means of automation such as scripts or rule-based expert systems.",
