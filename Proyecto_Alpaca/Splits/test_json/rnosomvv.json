Code Generation and Register Allocation Background When Edmar graduated in E.E. from Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro in 1981, he was already employed as software engineer at Racimec, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. As a part-time student, he earned his M.S. in computer science from COPPE in 1990. Edmar worked at Racimec for 11 years, where he developed hardware and real time software for microprocessor based products. Current Work In 1991, Edmar entered the Ph.D. program at Rice University, where he now is working on scheduling for superscalar architectures. He is investigating tighter initiation interval estimations for software pipelining based on register constraints, and an alternative method to schedule loops with conditional branchs.
