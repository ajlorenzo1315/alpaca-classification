Many recent algorithmic breakthrough --- both in algorithmic theory and in practical applications --- involve the use of randomness. For instance, the packet router in the CM-5 is randomized. So are many cryptographic schemes. The course will introduce students to this exciting area, while developing all required techniques from probabilistic analysis. The text will be Randomized Algorithms by R. Motwani and P. Raghavan, printed by Cambridge University Press. Both grads and undergrads are welcome to take the course. Other Suggested Books The probabilistic method. J. Spencer and N. Alon. W. Feller. (John Wiley) Course Topics Various tools for probabilistic analysis: Linearity of Expectations, Chebyshev's Inequality, Chernoff and Hoeffding bounds, Lovasz Local Lemma. Applications of these tools to design and analysis of algorithms. Markov chains. Various examples of randomized algorithms will be given throughout the course, including randomized data structures, game tree search, routing algorithms, algorithms for combinatorial optimization and linear programming, number theoretic algorithms, and algorithms for counting and uniform generation of combinatorial objects (such as matchings).
