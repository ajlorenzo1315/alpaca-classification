    "Cuerpo": "IMPORTANT: for problem 6, you should look at the postscript of the handout, and not the photocopied handouts in class, since the images were blackened out by the photocopying process. You should make your own test images, in addition to the ones here. The problem set is finalized, you need only submit the results for these two images below. left and right images from a stereo camera. You should submit the results starting from a zeroed disparity map and using this starting map (If you are using a linux or NT on an IBM, you should use this big-endian short image ). Using the ADT image libraries The following versions of the library are available SunOS available on the cs dept machines as ~robotlab/new/lib/libadt.a, with the appropriate header files in ~robotlab/new/include/adt/ . Sunlab: located in ~jmiller/664/libadt.a, with header files in ~jmiller/664/include. Solaris available on the cs dept machines as ~robotlab/new/lib/libadt-svr4.a, with the appropriate header files in ~robotlab/new/include/adt/ , be sure to include -DSVR4 on your command line . Linux: Here is the (ELF) library and a tarfile containing the header files . Problem Set 1: MINI-FAQ If the maximum absolute value of disparity is 8, then the disparity image should lose only 4 pixels on each side (because of the Cyclopean model), not 8 as mentioned in the HW assignment. Yes, I mixed this one up. If you correct the mistake, be sure to double the Delta constant to 20 when using the tree images, so that the disparity map I gave you will be the right size. What is the termination condition? The termination condition is NOT zero energy for the system, any interesting answer should have non-zero energy. How can I make my own test images? Answer 1: write a program to generate the images. A good answer to this was recently posted to sci.image.processing. interpretation of line drawings [Leclerc and Fischler 1992], object matching and recognition [Fischler and Elschlager 1973; Davis 1979; Shapiro and Haralick 1981; Bhanu and Faugeras 1984 ; Ben-Arie and Meiri 1987 ; Modestino and Zhang 1989 ; nasrabadi et al. 1990 ; Wells III 1991 ; Friedland and Rosenfeld 1992 ; Li 1992a ; Li 1994a] pose estimation [Haralick et al. 1989]",
