    "Cuerpo": "Our interests range from basic mathematical theory -- such as computational geometry, complexity theory, and number-theoretic algorithms -- to theoretical work on the foundations of electronic circuitry, communications, biology, cryptography, and computer architectures. While many of these models reflect recent technological advances -- parallel or distributed computing, for example -- work also is performed on such traditional models as finite automata and ordinary sequential computers. Parallel Algorithms Efficient Algorithms Scientific Computing Computational Biology Machine Learning Computational Complexity Cryptographic Protocols Program Semantics Distributed Computing MIT is the world's leader in parallel algorithms and architectures . We have developed improved approximation algorithms for a variety of problems, including those related to multicommodity flow and network design, as well as more specific problems such as the graph bisection problem or the maximum cut problem. Alan Edelman , Assistant Professor of Applied Mathematics (Scientific Computing) David R. Karger , Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering (Algorithms) Largely as a result of rapid advances in parallel computing technology, scientific computing has become one of computer science's most active areas. Computational biology represents another new and exciting research area. Some recent research themes include the inference of finite automata; learning in the presence of noise; learning an unknown environment \"piecemeal\" by exploration; learning of \"manifest\" systems (in which relevant variables are often, but not always, visible to the learner), and models of \"teaching.\" Another major theme is the development of new models of learning that provide better theoretical formulations of real-world learning situations and the appropriate algorithms. Shafrira Goldwasser , Professor of Electrical Engineering and  Computer Science (Cryptographic Protocols) Silvio Micali , Professor of Electrical Engineering and  Computer Science (Cryptographic Protocols) Cryptography is another important area of research within LCS. Protocol research has led to a complexity theory of the amount of knowledge that must be released in order for one processor to prove a fact to another processor -- the theory of \"zero-knowledge proofs.\" Michael Sipser, Professor of Applied Mathematics (Computational Complexity Theory) Mauricio Karchmer , Assistant Professor of Mathematics (Computational Complexity Theory) LCS also enjoys a traditional leadership role in computation complexity theory . One of the prime goals in this field is to devise and study natural schemes for classifying problems according to their computational difficulty, then place familiar and important problems within the appropriate scheme. One familiar example is the problem of factoring large integers -- that is, finding all the prime numbers that divide the integer evenly. While better algorithms are known, determining the intrinsic difficulty of the factoring problem is one of complexity theory's many exciting questions. Computer scientists' notion of a \"function,\" however, may depend on when and in what context it is evaluated. Nancy Lynch, Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (Distributed Computing) Baruch Awerbuch , Research Scientist (Distributed Computing) Distributed computation theory is designed to clarify the basic capabilities and limitations of concurrent and distributed computing systems. Research results include new algorithms and their analysis, impossibility results, formal concurrent-systems models, and models and techniques for proving correctness of concurrent algorithms. A basic problem in fault-tolerant computing is to cause processors to agree among themselves (about the value of a data item, say, or about a common course of action). The result of this project is the \"compilation\" of protocols that were designed for a relatively simple network model into protocols that run in a more complex, but more realistic, environment. LCS has developed an important formalism -- the Input/Output Automaton Model, a basic mathematical model for concurrent and distributed systems and their components.",
