This paper addresses the problem of circuit clustering for delay minimization, subject to area capacity constraints. We present an optimum polynomial time algorithm for combinational circuits under this model. Our algorithm can be generalized to solve the problem under any monotone clustering constraint. Contact: rraj@cs.utexas.edu Honghua Yang and D.F. Circuit Clustering for Delay Minimization under Area and Pin Constraints . In Proceedings of the International Workshop on Field Programmable Gate Arrays , February 1994. We consider the problem of circuit partitioning for multiple-chip implementation. Circuit partitioning with replication of logic gates is also called circuit clustering. In this paper, we present a circuit clustering algorithm that minimizes circuit delay subject to area and pin constraints on each chip, under the general delay model. Our algorithm is optimal under either the area constraint only or the pin constraint only. Contact: yanghh@cs.utexas.edu Honghua Yang and D. F. Wong. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design , Nov. 1994. However, network flow techniques were overlooked  as a viable approach to min-cut balanced bipartition due to its high complexity. In this paper we propose a balanced bipartition heuristic based on repeated max-flow min-cut techniques, and  give an efficient implementation that has the same asymptotic time complexity as that of one max-flow computation. We implemented our heuristic algorithm in a package called FBB. For example, the average elapsed time for bipartitioning a circuit S35932 of almost 20K gates is less than 20 minutes.",
