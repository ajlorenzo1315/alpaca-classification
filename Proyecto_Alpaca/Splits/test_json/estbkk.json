Option 1 is a case study in which you prepare a Software Quality Assurance Plan for an organization. Option 1 Software Quality Assurance Plan If you elect this option for Exercise 3, you must prepare a Software Quality Assurance Plan (SQAP) for the project described in the accompanying case study, SureSafe Security Systems Company. Supplier control 13. Risk management Additional information is available in IEEE Std 983, Guide for Software Quality Assurance Planning. Therefore, you may have to make assumptions and decisions about what the company is going to do to define and implement software quality assurance. Company Description: SureSafe Safety Systems is a relatively small company with a total employment of about 250 people. His replacement was Charles Taylor who joined SureSafe with no previous experience in the security systems field although he had 10 years of system design experience and 15 years of management experience in the electronics industry. In 1992 Mr. Taylor consolidated all of the staff responsible for software development activities into a single organization reporting directly to himself. They hired a consultant to review their development and quality assurances practices. He indicated that SureSafe personnel appeared to be generally unaware of the requirements for certification and the impact that these requirements might have on development practices. As a result, SureSafe hired another independent consultant to draft a Software Development Standard for use in all software development projects. Starting a New Project: While their 20+ year history has been successful, SureSafe now wishes to expand its operations by developing an easily expandable and customizable unit to allow them to be more cost competitive in existing markets and to enter additional markets  The Marketing group believes that technology has advanced to the point that this new product can be built and successfully sold to improve SureSafe's profitability. The ported code will be integrated with some new software being developed by SureSafe. Extensive reuse of code from existing SureSafe products is anticipated. SureSafe's New Products Development group, headed by Jerry Gibons, is performing all the electrical and mechanical design for the product. He has heard about your extensive experience in the software field and has retained you as a consultant. He wants you to study the situation and prepare a Software Quality Assurance Plan that will be effective in helping to ensure that only high quality products are delivered. Option 2 -- Review Guidelines If you elect this option, you must prepare comprehensive Review Guidelines for three of the following types of reviews: Software Requirements Reviews Preliminary Design Review (architectural design) Usability Review Detailed Design Review (logic design) Code Review Test Design Review Test Case Review User's Manual Review A review guideline must be a comprehensive list of items to check during the review. If you want to develop guidelines that are tailored to your own organization, you are welcome to do so provided your results aren't considered proprietary.",
