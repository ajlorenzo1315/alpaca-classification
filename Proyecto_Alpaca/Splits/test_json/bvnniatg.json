Program Statement For a user entering data to a program, any base could be used for either input or output. We often assume that the base is ten, but it would not have to be. Write a SAL program where the user enters 3 base ten integers. The first one will be the base to use for input, the second one will be the base to use for output, and the third will be the integer. The program prints out the user-entered integer in the user-entered base. Write the code such that the user-entered base will be in the range 1 < base <= 10. There should be one procedure that reads in a user-entered integer, and another that displays an integer in any base. Note that since the program will be doing input and output character by character, there are many user input errors that can be detected. Errors that should be handled include checking that the user-entered bases are in the correct range and detecting user-entered characters that could not be part of an integer. Comment your SAL program appropriately. Handing In the Program Turn in your program (the SAL source code) only once by running the script handin2 program2.s where program2.s is the name of the file containing the SAL program. Homework (3 points) Give a base 4 representation of the base 6 value 25.4. Show your work. (6 points) Fill in the missing entries in the following table. If the value required does not fit, write `overflow' for the answer. Truncate the repeating fraction at its least significant end. (4 points) What decimal value is represented by the IEEE single precision floating point representation (given in hexadecimal) 0xc3834000? (3 points) The SAL puts instruction is used to print out the string that starts at label string1 . The contents of memory (given in hexadecimal) are given by (address) (contents) ------ string  | 66 | ------ | 75 | ------ | 6e | ------ | 20 | ------ string1 | 73 | ------ | 74 | ------ | 75 | ------ | 66 | ------ | 66 | ------ | 21 | ------ | 00 | ------ | 42 | ------ | 59 | ------ | 45 | ------ What is printed by the puts instruction?",
