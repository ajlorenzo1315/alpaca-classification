    "Cuerpo": "Our group manages the operation and technical development of the Networked Computer Science Technical Reports Library (NCSTRL). This is an international consortium that maintains a distributed digital library of computer science research and collaborates on a number of digital library research issues. Dienst - An Architecture for Distributed Document Libraries . A protocol and server for a distributed technical report library . Cornell Computer Science Technical Report. Cornell Computer Science Technical Report. In this area, I have collaborated with the Corporation for National Research Initiatives to extend and implement a digital object framework developed as part of the DARPA-funded Computer Science Technical Report Project . I have authored or co-authored a number of papers in this area: Implementation Issues in an Open Architectural Framework for Digital Object Services . Cornell Computer Science Technical Report. Cornell Computer Science Technical Report. A Secure Repository Design for Digital Libraries . As part of this work, I am also a member of the Dlib working group on repository interfaces and co-author of the yet-to-be-released final report of the Metadata Workshop II in Warwick, U.K. Finally, and also as part of this work, I am very interested in extending the World Wide Web using distributed object technology. There is more to me than this research. Who knows, you may meet me at a conference, workshop, or meeting and find that out. That character on my lap in the picture at the top of this page is Lucy, my daughter. Toddlers are a constant challenge and joy. Put me in site of fast moving water or a quiet lakeand I will itch to get out on it in a canoe. Tell me I have a spare hour in my day and I will put on my running shoes and breath deeply the fresh air. I may spend much of my time in the digital world, but it will never be a substitute for the joys of the physical nor should it ever interfere with our desire to fight for its preservation.",
