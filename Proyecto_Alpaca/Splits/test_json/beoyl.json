To support this claim, we are utilizing planning and machine-learning techniques to develop an Internet softbot (software robot), a customizable and (moderately) intelligent assistant for Internet access. The softbot disambiguates the request and dynamically determines how and where to satisfy it. The softbot uses a UNIX shell and the World-Wide Web to interact with a wide range of internet resources. Take a tour of the softbot's graphical user interface . Try it!

CACM , July 1994. Methodological motivation for the project can be found here: Intelligence without Robots (A Reply to Brooks) . AI Magazine , December 1993. Technical softbot papers can be found here . A cartoon representation of the Internet softbot taken from the L.G. Blanchard article that appeared in the December 1994 issue of Columns , the University of Washington alumni magazine. The softbots research group is currently: Developing a graphical user interface to the softbot to allow the user to easily specify high level goals. Working on graphical specification of search control (Keith Golden) . Implementing an advanced plan space browser to debug planner control (Dave Christianson). Experimenting on reactive system in software domain (C. T. Kwok and T.J. Goan). Building an optimized agent Ingram for information gathering reactive system on the Internet. (C. T. Kwok).
