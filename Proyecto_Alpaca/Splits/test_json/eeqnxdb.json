Fees for the beginner class are arranged through the University. Beginner Class A beginner class is offered through the Sports Skills program once per quarter(Summer quarter excluded). This class covers basic Judo techniques with an emphasis on falls, basic throws, and basic pins. Chokes and/or armlocks are introduced. It is designed to promote awareness of Judo as well as provide a solid basis for continued practice. We also schedule a joint practice with area clubs every year. Our last tournament was Budokan, on May 25th. We also sent two people to nationals this year, where they took some pictures to document the experience.
