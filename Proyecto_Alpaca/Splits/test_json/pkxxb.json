    "Cuerpo": "I'm in my third year in the graduate program at the Computer Science Department at the University of Washington, slaving away toward the lofty goal of my Ph.D. I completed his undergraduate degree at the University of California at San Diego with an odd double-major in Computer Science and Political Science. I'm going on leave from graduate school in mid-December and I'm actively looking for a position in software development. Java Applets: WebView allows you to see the links to and from a page or set of pages. ATA and WebView have been highly rated by Gamelan and JARS . ATA was rated \"Top 1% of Java applets\" by JARS, \"What's Cool\" by Gamelan, and was a Gamelan staff pick. WebView was rated \"Top 5% of Java applets\" by JARS, \"What's Cool\" by Gamelan, and was a Gamelan staff pick. And AltaVistaWebView was one of the winners of the Java Repository Java Contest! Oops! You're not using a Java-capable browser. No cool Java applets for you. The LGrammer trees look much more realistic than the ParticleTree trees, but both are interesting. Very interesting work. At UCSD, I worked with Professor Rik Belew and Filippo Menzer on the Latent Energy Environments (LEE) project, a tool for developing artificial life models and experimenting with artificial neural network and evolutionary learning in software enviroments. Papers: S. Hanks, N. Lesh, G. Linden, Eliciting User Preferences:  The Automated Travel Assitant , Submitted to User Modeling 1996. S. Majeski, G. Linden, C. Linden, A. Spitzer, Modeling Localized Interaction:  Spatial Constraints in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma , Association of Economic Scientists 1996. Here's some of the images... The animation was written using SGI Inventor and C code to manipulate the 3D models. We have made a lower quality 27.5mb QuickTime movie available and a very low quality 6.5mb QuickTime movie available. Sorry, it just doesn't compress any further than this (at least with anything resembling reasonable quality).",
