Accordingly, we will develop several formal models of computation, each more powerful than the last. Homework Assignments When writing up your homework, there are two goals you must keep in mind: first, to give evidence that you have put real thought into the problem, and second, to convince the reader that your solution is correct and that you know why . As a programmer, you have some experience with this sort of writing: an effective program must be written for both a compiler and a human reader. Be careful to realize that this emphasis on presentation has nothing to do with whether English is your native language or whether you prefer to write your solutions with pencil, pen, quill, or word processor. Late Policy In general, you will have at least one week to work on a homework assignment and at least three opportunities to attend my office hours before that assignment is due. Assignments turned in more than a week after they were due will be scored at 0% of their face value --- that is, we will still attempt to evaluate them, but they will not count towards your grade.

None of the problems in this class are intended to have secret solutions; the more resourceful you are at discovering solutions, the more time you will have to write them well. Indeed, if you are stuck on a problem, I will be happy to talk with you about it during office hours. Copying a prepared solution is not collaboration at all; it is plagiarism. In order to bring this to my attention, you must prepare a written appeal with supporting documents and give it to me during the last week of class. If you don't know whether or how to write an appeal, use this as a guideline: I am likely to look more kindly upon \"That was just a really bad week for me\" than \"My homework was always late because I... uh... had a headache.\" Some announcements will be made only in class.
