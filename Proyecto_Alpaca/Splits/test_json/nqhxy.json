Hill, James R. Larus, Alvin R. Lebeck, Madhusudhan Talluri, and David A. Wood Computer Sciences Department University of Wisconsin 1210 West Dayton St. Madison, WI 53706 warts@cs.wisc.edu Wisconsin Architectural Research Tool Set (WARTS) is a collection of tools for profiling and tracing programs and analyzing program traces. WARTS currently contains: QPT and QPT2 , Program profiling and tracing system. Tycho and dineroIII , Cache simulators. WARTS is distributed with the full source and a small amount of documentation. A copy of the license is available on ftp.cs.wisc.edu in: ~ftp/pub/warts/license.ps or it can be obtained by writing to the address above. CPROF: The CPROF system is a cache performance profiler written by Alvin R. Lebeck and David A. The CPROF system consists of two programs: Cprof, a uniprocessor cache simulator, and Xcprof, an X windows user interface. Xcprof provides a generalized X windows interface for easy viewing of annotated source files. CPROF provides detailed information about a program's cache behavior through full cache simulation. By annotating lines of source code and data structures with the corresponding number of cache misses, CPROF helps the user focus on problematic data structures and algorithms. CPROF aids the programmer in identifying types of transformations that can improve program cache behavior by classifying cache misses as: compulsory, capacity, or conflict. 10, Oct. 1994, pp. Tycho and DineroIII: Tycho and dineroIII are uniprocessor cache simulators written by Mark Hill. The simulators report the behavior of one or more alternative cache designs in response to an input trace provided by the user (e.g., with QPT). Specifically, with one pass through an address trace, tycho will produce a table of miss ratios for caches of many sizes and associativities, provided that all caches have the same block (line) size, do no prefetching, and use LRU replacement. Tycho is used, for example, with the SPEC benchmark suite to examine numerous caches [2]. The second simulator, dineroIII, evaluates only one uniprocessor cache at a time, but produces more performance metrics (e.g., traffic to and from memory) and allows more cache design options to be varied (e.g., write-back vs. write-through, LRU vs. random replacement, demand fetching vs. prefetching). DineroIII is distributed for instructional use with a popular graduate computer architecture textbook [3]. [2] Jeffrey D. Gee, Mark D. Hill, Dionisios N.
