Blinn named this the blobby model . Years later, Wyvill, McPheeters, and Wyvill decided to apply the technique more generally to the modeling of soft objects, which are traditionally awkward at best to render. An almost equivalent but more efficient version of the function is: [3] C(r) = ar^6/R^6 + br^4/R^4 + cr²/R² + 1 where the values of a , b , and c are found by solving with the following constraints: C(0.0) = 1.0 C(R) = 0.0 C'(0.0) = 0.0 C'(R) = 0.0 C(R/2) = 0.5 yielding: a = -0.444444 b = 1.888889 c = -2.444444 In 1991, Shigeru Muraki took it one step further, and applied blobby models on range data to visualize very interesting objects such as human faces. Immediately obvious from his research is that to achieve a reasonable degree of realism modeling anything other than simple molecules, a blobby model should be composed of a large number (typically hundreds) of atoms. However, since the creation of the model involves the placement of many atoms, manual design ceases to be a good option quickly. The Blobby Modeler was designed to ease the task of the creation of models, as well as compute the resulting density field off-line to prevent overloading DX . Simplicity - the software should be easy to use and maintain, because it should run alongside DX . In addition, it provides a free window in which a camera can be placed in 3-space and the model previewed. To facilitate the development of the user interface, I selected the Tcl/Tk Toolkit versions 7.3 and 3.6, respectively. The C portion turned out to include only the functions that generate the field (including a horrible quadruple-nested loop) and those that manage the free window (which implement the 3-D transforms and 2-D projections). Since this was my first Tcl/Tk program, it's performance can likely be improved by rewriting some routines. There are subtle differences between my implementation and HTML. Despite that, conversion between the two formats should not be difficult. Conclusions and Future Directions: At its present state, Blobby Modeler is a complete 3-D editing platform ready for beta-testing. Undoubtedly as it undergoes actual usage, problems will arise and enhancements will be made. It will prevent the small trouble of having to go over the DX in order to render the scene. It is my hope that actual users will determine the usefulness of the program. Volumetric Shape Description of Range Data using \"Blobby Model\".",
