Click on the Save As... button and enter the name of the file. Similar to step 3 in the Windows version, enter the field name and the field type. Data types are the same in DOS as in Windows . Hence, if an attribute is (part of) a primary key of an alphanumeric type with a size of 10 characters, the \"Field Type\" is \"A10*\". Select Table/Edit/Data from the menu bar or press F9 . When finished entering data, select Table/End/Edit or press F9 . MS-DOS If the table to be edited is not present on the desktop: 1. Just click on the table and press F9 to allow editing of the table and hit F2 to save modifications made to the table. Select the table involved in the query. If there are other tables involved in the query, select Query/Add Table... from the menu bar to select more tables involved in the query. Repeat this for all tables involved in the query. Hit the F6 key or click on the little white box in the field and a check will appear in the field. Select the table containing the attributes on which you want to select. Select a table to be joined. For this type of query we will need to first create a set of tuples for comparison and compare the set to another table; we then perform other selections and projections after grouping as explained in the following example. Now we need to compare this set of Dno's with the departments in the employee table to find all of the employees who work in all (or none of the) departments. Select the Field Dno in the Employee table to compare with the set. If the query is not on the desktop, i.e., needs to be read in from a file, click on File/Open/Query in the menu bar and select the QBE file to be opened.",
