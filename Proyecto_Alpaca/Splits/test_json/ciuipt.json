    "Cuerpo": "Here it is: How did this happen? Your computer has more power than the combined power of all the computers in the world 50 years ago. But there's another explanation for this extraordinary development -- this explosion of computing power and its migration to all corners of our life. There are lines in that song that contain part of the answer to the puzzle of this card. A key explanation for this Valentine's Day Card, for my cool wristwatch, for your red-hot laptops is that the federal government provided the initial spark that eventually flickered into these extraordinary products. In the early days of the ENIAC, nobody knew where it would all lead. Then in 1986, the National Science Foundation -- again, an agency of the federal government -- began what was called the NSFNET to expand the ARPANET to include not simply computer nerds, but  all researchers at American universities. That led to the National Research and Education Network, or NREN, which I helped get off the ground. And that eventually led to the Internet -- the organic network of networks that today is bursting with new users, creating entirely new industries, and reshaping how we work and how we communicate. But that wasn't the point. Government has supplied the initial flicker -- and individuals and companies have provided the creativity and innovation that kindled that spark into a blaze of progress and productivity that's the envy of the world. But now there are some in Washington who seem intent on snuffing out this spark with the largest cuts in science and technology and education in a generation. Because he understands that the ENIAC changed not only how send valentines, but how we think about our world. For years, much of our thinking was shaped by the metaphor of the factory. It changed our world, and demanded a new vocabulary to describe it. I think there's a better metaphor . It's the metaphor of distributed intelligence. The CPU would send out to the field of memory for raw information that needed to be processed, bring it back to the center, do the work, and then distribute the answer back into the field of memory. But the ENIAC -- funded by a small investment from Washington  -- provided the spark  . You don't have to rely on distributed intelligence for that one, do you?",
