At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, scientists from chemistry, computer science, genetics, mathematics, molecular biology, plant pathology, and other disciplines are applying computational methods to various biological problems. Some investigations in the Department of Computer Sciences involve DNA sequencing and analysis, experiment management, modelling of ecological communities, protein-folding prediction, and species identification. Cross-disciplinary training programs are available for graduate students interested in careers in computational biology. Research groups investigating computational problems in biology are in three subfields of computer science: artificial intelligence, databases, and theory. The artificial intelligence group working with Professor Jude Shavlik applies machine learning techniques to several problems in molecular biology. Problems under investigation include: predicting protein secondary-structure; distinguishing protein-coding and noncoding regions; and recognizing promoters, splice junctions, terminators, introns, and ribosome-binding sites. Machine learning methods aid in the discovery of concepts underlying phenomena through the examination of multiple examples. This technique is powerful and potentially very valuable to the biological community. The database group headed by Professors Yannis Ioannidis and Miron Livny is developing a desktop experiment management system that will assist scientists in managing their experimental studies. The goal of the system is to have a single tool controlling the experimentation processes, managing the generated data, and efficiently processing user requests for data. This project proceeds in collaboration with several laboratories on campus, primarily those in the Departments of Soil Sciences, Molecular Biology, and Genetics. The research group led by Professor Deborah Joseph applies techniques from theoretical computer science to develop algorithms for computational biology applications. For instance, in collaboration with a group in plant pathology, one class of DNA sequence is being used to develop quantitative methods for identifying possible biological control organisms in ecological communities. The Applied Mathematics Training Program is being established to train scientists to effectively apply mathematical and computational tools to a wide range of scientific endeavors. Although specific to mathematical applications, students in this program can address a broad range of research problems including many in the biological sciences. Training Programs Applied Mathematics Training Program Biotechnology Training Program Amy Kryder (kryder@cs.wisc.edu) and Carolyn Allex (allex@cs.wisc.edu) are current holders of Biotechnology Training fellowships; feel free to contact them with questions about the program. The subdirectory machine-learning/shavlik-group contains additional papers by Shavlik's research group.
