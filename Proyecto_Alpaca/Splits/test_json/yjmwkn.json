This document tells the story from the perspective of another field:  information technology, focusing on the Department of Computer Science & Engineering and touching on related programs in the mathematical sciences and in engineering. Universities transfer technology in two ways . It's this pattern of innovation and technology transfer -- the fluid interaction between academia and industry -- that has made America the world leader in information technology, and that will help us maintain this critical lead. The unique genius of America's university system is that it combines research and education -- ideas and people . Three other faculty members in my department were Andy's undergraduate students. For further information , see the Computing Research Association's web-based monograph \"Computing Research:  Driving Information Technology and the Information Industry Forward\" (http://cra.org/research.impact/), and Ed Lazowska's 1996 University of Washington Annual Faculty Lecture, \"A Half Century of Exponential Progress in Information Technology:  Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How\" (http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/lazowska/faculty.lecture/), plus their associated links. The University of Washington's Role The University of Washington is a very special institution . These programs provide a first-rate education to Washington residents . The University of Washington Department of Computer Science & Engineering is ranked among the top ten programs in the nation, both for the quality of its graduate/research programs and for the quality of its undergraduate programs. This is the kind of education that the University of Washington strives to provide. The University of Washington is the largest supplier of new college graduates in the nation to Microsoft. The UW Department of Computer Science & Engineering is essentially the only supplier to a number of major regional firms such as DECwest Engineering, Geoworks/Seattle, and Tera Computer. Programs such as CSE import new technology to the Northwest . DECwest Engineering, Geoworks/Seattle , and Tera Computer Company are among the companies that were attracted to the region in part because of the strength of UW CSE. Semiconductor design house IC Designs was founded by John Torode, a UW CSE alumnus, based in part upon UW CSE technology ; IC Designs was recently sold to industry leader Cypress Semiconductor. CP/M (Control Program / Microcomputer), the loser to Microsoft's MS-DOS as the operating system for IBM's new personal computer, was designed and implemented by UW CSE alumnus Gary Kildall and his company, Digital Research, Inc . The new field of \"shape photography\" was pioneered by faculty from UW CSE, Mathematics, and Statistics , and the company Manifold Graphics was recently founded to commercialize this technology. In 1996, two additional companies were founded to commercialize UW CSE computer graphics technologies: Inklination (focused on computer-generated pen-and-ink illustration ), and Numinous Technologies, Inc. (initially focused on two technologies -- duotone printing and wavelet-based image database querying -- but expecting to license additional UW computer graphics innovations). UW CSE's annual Affiliates Meeting is a forum for interaction among more than 50 leadership companies from the region and the nation.",
