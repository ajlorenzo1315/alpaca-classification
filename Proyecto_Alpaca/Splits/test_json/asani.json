Upon completion of the course, the student will be able to design simple digital integrated circuits for a number of technologies (MOS and bipolar) and will be familiar with the use of modern Computer Aided Design Tools. As such he/she will be able to work in a team of designers. Next the design of more complex combinational gates, such as NAND, NOR and EXORs, will be discussed, looking at optimizing the speed, area or power. The influence of interconnect parasitics on the design performance and approaches to cope with them is treated. The course will be concluded with a discussion of design methodologies. Significant emphasis is placed on the use of CAD Tools (SPICE and MAGIC) for homework, labs and projects. Chapters 1-5 will be for sale at the end of the first week of class. They are due the next week before 5pm on Wednesday. They can be returned either in class or deposited in a special box, located in 558 Cory Hall, next to the desk of Corey Schaffer. The software and hardware materials will be available from Copy Central the second week of class. The first lab is the second week of the semester and is on the MAGIC layout system. Grades The course puts a considerable emphasis on the design aspect of the digital design process.
