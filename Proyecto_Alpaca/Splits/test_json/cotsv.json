    "Cuerpo": "We'll announce later how we'll get HW6 back to you (it may be at the final exam). 11/19/96 HW#5 and Windows 3.1 : In case you're running Windows 3.1 at home, we have a 16-bit executable version of the demo which can be downloaded. If you're using Windows 95 or Windows NT, please don't even bother; if you are on Windows 3.1, try it out and let us know if you encounter any problems. HW#5 is now open for turn-in . If that was your situation , please send us a short e-mail to that effect (it does not have to have a lengthy justification, just a note as to your name, section, student number, and a brief reason) and we will set up a special period when turnin for HW#4 will be open again. Meanwhile, if you have Windows 3.1 at home, the hw5orig.c program will probably compile, but we're not sure if it will run properly unless you happen to have the Borland C++ version 4.5 compiler installed; in any case, you will need to figure out how to create a project file or make file that pulls together all the required files. In any case: for now, please ignore question #3 ; we'll come back to it another time. So that means if you have a question that you want answered individually, as opposed to just a comment, please send it as an e-mail or talk to us in office hours; or you could include your e-mail address in the comment. In any case, the comments are really valuable to give a sense of how we are doing as well what some of your individual experiences and concerns are. You can get to it from here or from the main Web page. HW#3 is now open for turn-in . A sample solution for HW#2 will be posted (on the HW#2 page) within a couple of days. If you're sure our program is not right for a particular case, then you don't have to make yours do the same wrong thing. 10/11/96 We've put a new version of the HW#2 archive on the Web. You can find it on the Web. They are not in MSVC, but rather are files we created and posted on the course Web. We hope it will be open during the hours posted in the lab information page, but in case it's not, please leave room for recovery, that is, don't leave the homework until the last day. Do it now if you haven't already. 10/3/96 Homework #1 is now on the Web. The final exam for 142 will be on Tuesday, December 17, in Kane 120 , and will be 2 hours long.",
