The research focus is to promote productivity of engineering system design using rapidly improving information technology. Faculty Moon Jung Chung Anthony Wojcik Diane Rover Michele Shanblatt Chin Long Wey Research Projects Design Process Reengineering of Digital Circuits Parallel Simulation Verification of Properties of Digital Systems Improved Placement Methodolgy for Low Power VLSI Circuits DESIGN PROCESS MANAGEMENT Principal Investigators: Moon Jung Chung and Anthony Wojcik As the complexity of products increases, companies need to develop solid and effective process management for various aspects of production, allowing them to promote productivity and to fully utilize the rapid progress in information technology. Our approach is based on formal modeling of design process using process grammar. This research work has been supported by the Air Force Wright Patterson Laboratory, and System Engineering Research Institute. PARALLEL SIMULATION Principal Investigator: Moon Jung Chung Simulation is a bottleneck in a design process. The focus of the research is on Parallel VHDL Performance Simulation. REENGINEERING OF DIGITAL CIRCUITS Principal Investigators: Anthony Wojcik, Moon Jung Chung, Bill Punch and Jon Sticklen Of considerable interest in the design automation community is the problem of reengineering, or redesign, of electronic circuits. Hence, redesign starts with only partial knowledge of the target system and must infer original specifications. Our approach to this problem incorporates the use of formal methods. Formal methods refers to the collection of approaches based on mathematical logic and formal proof techniques used for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems. Our work includes the use of a variety of formal methods including automated reasoning, genetic algorithms, and knowledge- based systems. VERIFICATION OF PROPERTIES OF DIGITAL SYSTEMS Principal Investigator: Anthony Wojcik As systems become ever more complex, it becomes increasingly important to be able to verify properties about systems. Clearly, one property is that the system functionally implements the intended specification. A critical problem is the modeling of properties of systems and then the verification of the properties. It is clear that simulation alone cannot be used to verify properties. For that reason, the use of formal methods continues to be of great importance. Formal methods refers to the collection of approaches based on mathematical logic and formal proof techniques used for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems. Our work is concerned both with the use of appropriate representations for modeling systems and properties of systems, and the application of techniques incorporating automated reasoning systems, Prolog and other approaches in order to prove properties of systems. Improved Placement Methodolgy for Low Power VLSI Circuits Principal Investigator: Michael Shanblatt Graduate Student: Manuel Jimenez Reducing the amount of power dissipated by integrated circuits has become an issue of major concern in the design of digital VLSI systems.",
