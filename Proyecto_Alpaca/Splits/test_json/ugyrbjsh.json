The project proposal should contain a short description of: the topic/problem in which you're interested the papers that you'll read (if you're doing a \"reading\" project) a description of the general approach you plan to use to solve the problem (if you're doing a \"programming\" project) plan for evaluation of the theory/technique (for both types of project) What to Turn in for the Project Official due date: Friday 5/3. Programming projects: Final Writeup for Programming Projects (just a few pages): Problem description Description of general approach Description and results of evaluation Discussion. Non-Programming projects: Final Writeup for Non-programming Projects. This will vary for each person, but in general, the final writeup for non-programming projects will probably contain a description of the problem that you looked at; a summary of the papers that you read; a critique of the existing approaches; your attempt at an evaluation of the the theory/algorithms presented in the papers on real text. In-Class Presentation: For non-programming projects, the in-class presentation should be a synopsis of what you'll include in the paper. Programming Projects from Last Year's Class Grammar Induction using Genetic Algorithms This project implements a grammar generator using genetic algorithms. AutoSlog and FALCON:  Automated Lexicon Construction This paper evaluates the performance of AutoSlog and FALCON as lexicon constructors. Statistical Word Sense Disambiguation This project implements a number of related statistical methods for word-sense disambiguation and evaluates the method using examples from the Brown corpus. Automated English-Esperanto Translation This project implements a limited English-Esperanto translator by extending James Allen's bottom-up parser. An Implementation of a Method for Word Sense Disambiguation This project implements a relaxation network approach (like CIRCUS's) for word-sense disambiguation. The Viterbi Algorithm and Smoothing This project is an implementation of a part-of-speech tagger using a Hidden Markov Model, a smoothed bigram language model, and the Viterbi algorithm. Using FOIL for WH-Phrase Disambiguation This paper examines ways to use FOIL for  WH-phrase disambiguation. Natural Language Understanding of the Japanese Language This paper summarizes issues for understanding Japanese. Word Boundary Detection in Continuous Speech Recognition: Application of Phonological Constraints This paper looks at three models that use broad class, phonemic sequence, and allophonic constraints to facilitate word boundary detection. An Analysis of Transformation-Based Part of Speech Tagging This paper critiques the an article on transformation-based part of speech tagging. Neural Networks and NLU This paper looks at neural network applications for natural language understanding. Pronominal Anaphora Resolution This paper describes four approaches to the computational task of resolving the pronoun referents. Harmonic Grammars and Unaccusativity This paper looks at Harmonic Grammars developed by Smolensky, Legendre and Miyata. Return to CS674 home page",
