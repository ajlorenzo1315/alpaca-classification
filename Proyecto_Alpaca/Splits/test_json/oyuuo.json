    "Cuerpo": "Hypertext is the idea of creating a link from part of one document to another part of a document (either the same document, or a different one). In a hypertext system some standard method of specifying links must be created. Complete . Printable Any URI uses only 7-bit ASCII characters, and is designed to be easily readable. The URI specification was in turn used to write specifications for the naming of documents or services available through existing internet protocols. The CS http server and relative URLs When people talk about putting documents on the Web, they are usually referring to putting their document in the namespace of a Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP server. The http server provides each user with their own Web namespace, starting in the directory ~/public/html . The server has the permissions of any other user, so the files in this directory must be readable by any user. We will describe what the full URL of this namespace later in this document. URLs are similar to pathnames in a file-system, and just as with pathnames it is possible to construct relative URLs. URLs name documents relative to the URL of the document a link is being made from . The name the http server uses for each user's web names pace is `` /~ username / ''. If you wanted to link to my home page from a document in your directory, you could use the relative URL `` /~keeper/keeper.html ''. Full URLs To link to a file or service that is not on the CS http server, you need to know its full URL. The full URL for my home page is: http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~keeper/keeper.html Another useful URL type is ftp , which allows you to link to files on anonymous FTP servers. The URL for the condor directory on the CS FTP server is: ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/condor/ Access Control, Tricks, and Details Linking to parts of documents To create a link to a specific part of a document, that document must be written in HTML, and contain a named anchor (see the tutorial ). The URL would simply be the URL of the file followed by a hash mark (``#'') and the name of the anchor. If the anchor is in the same document the URL is just `` # anchorname ''. Many people like to make a link from index.html to their home page (as in ln -s username .html index.html ) so that when the URL http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ username / is requested their home page is returned. To make a link that fingers a user from a document on our server, you can use the relative URL: /cgi-bin/finger?",
