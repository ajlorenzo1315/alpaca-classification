    "Cuerpo": "His research interests include parallel algorithms, parallel production systems, application of parallel computers in artificial intelligence, parallel computational geometry, computational chemistry, and parallel computer models. He has also published in the areas of Banach spaces and general topology. and Ph.D. degree in mathematics in 1965 and 1968 respectively, from the University of Texas in Austin. Recent Research Activities: A major focus of Baker's recent research has been the development of a computational model for associative computing and establishing algorithms and software for this model. The associative model is designed to provide a common platform for the development of appropriate algorithms and software for massively parallel computers in general and an extended version of SIMD computers in particular. Current work is underway to compare this model to other parallel models of computation, including the reconfigurable mesh and the mesh with multiple broadcasts.
