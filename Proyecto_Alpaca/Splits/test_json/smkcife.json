Research Interests: Integrating heterogeneous data sources Content-based querying and indexing of sequence and image data Exploratory analysis of large data sets (data mining) Extending database query languages using constraints and deduction As the use of databases grows and diversifies, it is increasingly important to be able to access data from dispersed, heterogeneous, independently developed sources easily. In the RODIN project, and its successor, the C.O.D. project, I am investigating several issues: formal techniques and practical toolkits for semantic integration, supporting multiple levels of service and access to a database, and database access in a networked cluster of machines. This is joint work with Profs. In recent work, the results on visual data exploration from the NEXT! project, which is joint work with Prof. Livny, are being applied to data integration, and querying over the Web. The SEQ system deals with queries over sequence data, and focuses on DBMS design and optimization issues related to sequence data. It is a part of the NEXT! project, and is joint work with Prof. Livny. In the PIQ project, the goal is to support content-based retrieval from large sets of images. Our focus is on developing and implementing an expressive data definition language that can be used to customize a general image database system to take advantage of specialized information about a given collection of images that is to be indexed and queried. My interest in querying and analysis of data covers data exploration and mining. project. A long-standing research interest is the extension of relational database query languages with logic programming features such as structured terms and recursion, and the use of arithmetic constraints to specify data and queries more compactly and efficiently. An ongoing project involves the continued development and use of the CORAL deductive system. Research Projects: CORAL C.O.D. Graduates S.
