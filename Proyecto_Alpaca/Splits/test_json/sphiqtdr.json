    "Cuerpo": "(Actually, it is under construction, but I didn't want to contribute to the over use of the phrase \"under construction.\" (From a book by Jane Austen) Hint:  To get to the interesting stuff, visit my friends' home pages. Links that I actually use! Links to the homepages of friends Kris Nelson's Home Page (He's in Spain, so this probably hasn't been updated recently) John Dockstader's Homepage. Home Page (Not exactly a friend, but I spend a lot of time with it, so...) This is the place where I would but a link to the homepage of my boyfriend if my boyfriend had a home page (hint hint John). Technically, he does have a home page, but it says \"go 'way\" on it, so I decided not to link to it. When I do graduate, I'll graduate with honors in Computer Science and a math degree. Computer Science I like because I get a chance to program, which can be very, very fun (okay, so I am a nerd--but so is Bill Gates). Programming, at least for me, can be as frustrating at its worst moments as it can be fun at its best. Family I have two brothers, one of whom is here at the U.W. My other brother is in 10th grade (I would have used that cool word for 10th grader, but I can't spell) at Hazen High School. He also is the one who maintains and upgrades my computer. (I have a fairly nice computer because of that, too.) (Of course, this is kinda balanced out by the fact that all my Dad's family is in Norway.) Seriously, for the most part, I kinda enjoy school. But what do I do outside of school, you ask. I do like talking to people, and there is that ocassional child (or more often adult) who seems really interested in the animals, and it is fun to talk to those sort of people. I also enjoy reading, in particular, I really like Jane Austen. When I'm in an escapist mood, and I've reread Jane Austen too recent for it to be much of an escape, I sometimes read Science Fiction/Fantasy novels. Fun book, but I wish that there was more math in it.",
