How can I register my page with you? How do I refine MetaCrawler searches? What are your plans to commercialize the MetaCrawler? What is MetaCrawler? MetaCrawler is a free World Wide Web search service. MetaCrawler differs from other services in that it doesn't maintain any internal database. Using the MetaCrawler, you're able to see one page which contains all of the references from each service -- this way, you won't miss anything! Thus, when MetaCrawler returns a reference, it sums the scores given by each service and presents them in a ``voted'' ordering. How do I refine MetaCrawler searches? Another method is to use MetaCrawler's advanced search syntax: When you create a search, specify groups of words by surrounding them in quotes. They are, therefore, only suggestions that MetaCrawler will use when tailoring each source's query. Can I put a MetaCrawler form and logo on my page? We are happy to have you link to our page or have a MetaCrawler form on your page, and you're welcome to use our logo to accent that link or form as well! You may copy the logo directly from mc-logo.gif (or mc-anim2.gif for the animated logo). The general and iface fields are the only ones required by MetaCrawler; defaults will be used for any others if they are not specified. However, we are considering options to commercialize this technology.",
