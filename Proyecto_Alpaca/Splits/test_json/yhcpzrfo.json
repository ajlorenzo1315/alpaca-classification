Sweany Steve Carr Current Graduate Students: Chen Ding Saurabh Jang Evan L. Schemm Thomas R. Suchyta Qunyan Wu Current Undergraduates: Denise Junker Denise Wieber Description: The goals of the Rocket project are to develop a retargetable compiler for instruction-level parallel architectures and to develop scheduling and register allocation algorithms for said architectures. Current research efforts include software pipelining, register-sensitive scheduling, and register allocation and scheduling for partitioned register files. Publications: S. J. Beaty, S. Colcord, P.H.
