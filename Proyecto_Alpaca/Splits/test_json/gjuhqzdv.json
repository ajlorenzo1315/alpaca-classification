    "Cuerpo": "\"Par\" for a hole is generally the score that a good golfer would receive on that hole, and par for the entire course is the sum of the pars for each individual hole. If a golfer scored 3 on each hole on that course, the golfer would have a score of 27, which is very good, since it is less than, or \"under\" par. If, on the other hand, a golfer scored 5 on each hole, the golfer would have a score of 45, and would be 9 over par, which is not as good. Thus, each player will have a different score for each of the 5 courses. The file will have the following form: 36 35 36 33 32 124 37 33 35 37 35 2353 37 35 34 32 33 3457 40 31 32 35 28 532 32 35 34 34 30 -1 The first line lists the par score for each of the 5 courses. Thus, the first golfer has an ID of 4343, and has scores of 37, 33, 35, 37, and 35. Thus, you may NOT assume anything about the number of golfers, the par scores for the 5 rounds, and so on. Your job is to: Determine the score for each golfer - that is, the golfer's score relative to the par score. Determine the average score for each course, and the average par score for all golfers. The winner is player #532 with a score of 7 under par. Next, the golfer's scores on each of the courses is displayed. Thus, that golfer's total score (171), is one less than the par score, so a -1 is recorded as the golfer's final par, signaling 1 under par. The scores for the remaining 2 golfers are then printed out, as well as their final scores (6 and 7 under par). Finally, the average tournament par score for all golfers is printed out. Please note that I may use a different input file when testing your program, but it will have the same name and will be formatted in the same way as golfin.txt and the example given above. You should also be sure to make up your own input files to use to test your program as well. You should name the output file produced by your program \"golfout.txt.\" You need not do any error checking when you read in the data from the file except for the following: if one of the input scores is smaller than the number of holes (9), which is of course impossible, your program should penalize that cheater by changing the score on that round to 200. Your program should print out the following statements to the screen: Beginning file processing.... What To Turn In Once you have your program working, you should use the test file provided, \"golfin.txt\", as your input file.",
