    "Cuerpo": "Berks County, Pennsylvania, is considered an outlying part of Pennsylvania Dutch Country , which consists roughly of the counties of Berks, Lebanon (pronounced ``Leb'nin''), and Lancaster, with its center in Lancaster County. There is only one `waul' in Dutchy. Dutchies speak a language entirely their own. In any case, this language consists of a number of consonant sounds and one vowel phoneme, which can be written /au/. Apparently the wegetables vere grexing. Dutchies don't have any appreciation for good food, like pizza: I've seen four pizza places in the exact same location go in and out of business one right after another. But you can take comfort in the fact that although it is impossible to get real pizza in Berks County, you'll never find a better chicken barbecue. This favorite food of the true traditional Dutchy is an entire chicken (or a pig for some of the larger representatives of the Dutchy species), roasted over a fire and eaten whole:  bones, entrails, and all. But they don't just make donuts--they've introduced an improved food variety all their own, called ``faustnauchts.'' A few hundred years ago one Dutchy fellow named Jesus (pronounced `Cheesaus') fed five thousand people with just five faustnauchts and a couple of barbecued chickens. My dad puts faustnauchts in the trunk of his car during the vinter to give him better traction in the snow. There is only one highway through Berks County. Even if you actually wanted to visit Reading, it turns out that it is not really possible. There is only one highway that runs through Berks County. It runs from west to east, from Leb'nin County to Schuykill County. And perhaps ``highway'' isn't really the right word to describe Berks County's only road. Most highways don't have traffic lights every hundred yards for the entire length of the road, from one end of the county to the other. Any mention of fictitious persons, real or otherwise, was not meant to reflect upon the character of the character upon whom it was meant to reflect. In short, the author does not wish to be held responsible for any of the above, which he swears he did not even write. pierce@cs.cornell.edu",
