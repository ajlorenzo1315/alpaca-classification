    "Cuerpo": "Research Interests Negotiation among computationally bounded self-interested agents , multiagent systems, distributed problem solving, distributed artificial intelligence, negotiation, coalition formation, electronic commerce, resource-bounded reasoning, normative methods for system design, machine learning, combinatorial optimization, scheduling. Such settings occur for example in production scheduling in multi-enterprise agile manufacturing, in negotiations with real-world subcontractors, in vehicle routing among dispatch centers of different companies, in meeting scheduling, in classroom scheduling etc. In the Finnish system, the B.S. Extended the contract net framework towards working among self-interested agents whose rationality is limited by computational complexity. Explored the advantages of different modes of commitment and the use of marginal costs in negotiation among intelligent agents. Developed a method for calculating the value of probabilistic information and a way to use this value for optimal termination of anytime algorithms by conditioning the algorithm's perfomance profile on execution so far.
