    "Cuerpo": "If it were easy to compare prices, consumers would benefit substantially, and every consumer would be able to get the best price. Because of the Web, it may now be possible to create an efficient market for many mass-produced consumer items. There are several hundred vendors who sell mail-order peripherals, and it isn't easy to compare prices. Items on these markets (such as Hewlett-Packard stock) are available for a single price at any given time, and that price is widely known. PriceWeb is an attempt to create an efficient market in computer peripherals. In an efficient market, most vendors would have to lower their prices. But in the long term there are advantages for vendors as well. The average price spread on items that PriceWeb covers is $130, and some items have large price spreads. For instance, each vendor could sell slightly different items. This pattern would be fairly easy to spot in an efficient market with  pricing information available on-line. While a few vendors (such as Computability ) provide on-line pricing information, most do not -- in fact, surprisingly few vendors have Web sites. Even if most vendors put their pricing information on-line, it may be hard to compare prices. I believe that consumers will not use PriceWeb if they have to pay for it. There are companies that think consumers will pay for such a service -- CyberSave Shopper , for example. An efficient market requires perfect information; as the costs associated with information fall, the market can become more efficient. There are costs associated with obtaining pricing information for computer peripherals. An efficient market could eliminate many middlemen. An efficient market in consumer goods would have a substantial impact on society. For example, it could eliminate many retail stores in favor of mail-order vendors, who can locate in areas with low fixed costs. For some items (such as Tylenol), the savings may be so small that it isn't worthwhile to find the best price.",
