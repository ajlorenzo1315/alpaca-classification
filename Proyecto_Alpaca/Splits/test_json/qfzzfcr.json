    "Cuerpo": "Monday, 23 Sep 96 No Seminar (Yom Kippur) Monday, 30 Sep 96 Professor Pei Cao will give a \"meet the faculty\" overview talk on her research in file systems. Monday, 07 Oct 96 Professor Miron Livny will give a \"meet the faculty\" overview talk on the Condor research project. Monday, 21 Oct 96 Bryan Wylie Monday, 28 Oct 96 Steven Fought on Java (here are his slides from the talk ). Monday, 04 Nov 96 Scott Colville on extensible operating systems and the SPIN kernel. So, some people signed up for a waiting list (you know who you are). They'll get first dibs for next semester's seminar: Choosing a Talk The first choice is to give a talk on research which you are doing. Alternatively, you can give a talk on just about anything related to operating systems. I've put together a list of recent conference papers which should make for interesting talks. (Of course, you don't need to limit your choices to this list; they're just suggestions.) The papers are mostly from SOSP 15 (Fifteenth ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles; December, 1995), OSDI-I (First USENIX Symposium on Operating System Design and Implementation; November, 1994), HotOS-V (Fifth Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems; May, 1995) , ASPLOS-VII (Seventh ACM Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems) , and OSDI-II .
