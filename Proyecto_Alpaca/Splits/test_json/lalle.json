Processor Technologies One of the early contributions in instruction level parallel (also called ILP) processor technology was the development of the decoupled architecture concept. What is now commonly regarded as the first commercially-available superscalar processor, the Astronautics ZS-1, appeared in 1988 and was developed as a direct spin-off of the University of Wisconsin research efforts. Several other soon-to-be-announced superscalar processors also have the above mechanisms at their core. Industrially-relevant work in ILP processors is continuing at UW. Cache Memory Systems Wisconsin researchers have also had a long history of contributions in the design of memory systems, particularly caches. In the area of cache design, Goodman showed how Static-Column DRAMs (SCRAMs) can be used as a \"poor man's\" cache, providing some of the benefits of cache memory without using SRAM. For example, both Sun Microsystems and Compaq have built computers containing SCRAM caches, direct-mapped caches are now at least as common as set-associative ones, multi-megabyte second level caches are widely used, and most recently-announced superscalar microprocessors use non-blocking caches. Multiprocessor Systems In multiprocessor systems, Goodman published the first paper describing a snooping cache coherence protocol. Some microprocessors, such as the Motorola 88000, have implemented almost exactly the write-once protocol as described by Goodman. Goodman and Sohi contributed to the IEEE standard 1596 Scalable Coherent Interface, the first commercial-grade directory-based coherence scheme. Another synchronization mechanism invented by UW researchers is a novel technique to combine Fetch&Increment operations. Another area of contributions is memory consistency models which specify the semantics of shared memory. Wisconsin researchers were among the first to recognize that memory consistency was not synonymous with cache coherence. Practical research in multiprocessors is continuing at Wisconsin. Wood and Hill advanced the state-of-the-art of trace sampling techniques, which are important techniques in the study of very large caches. Equally important, Wisconsin researchers have transferred their new techniques and software tools to industry and academia so that others can synergistically build on the work.
