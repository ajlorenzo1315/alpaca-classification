I may have a copy you can borrow.) These notes are also available on the Web in pdf format, but I strongly advise you to pick up a printed copy so you can take notes on them in class. Assignments : There will be both written homework and laboratory exercises. A lab project will dominate towards the end of the quarter. During the first week I will assign everyone into teams of three and four students. You will have to work together to solve some of the homework assignments and work on the labs. Each member of the team will be responsible for the performance of all other team members; that is, the entire team must understand the solution and contribute to part of it. We will talk about this in more detail later. Quizzes and Exams : There will be a mid-term exam. from ? Quizzes and the final exam will be open book and open notes.
