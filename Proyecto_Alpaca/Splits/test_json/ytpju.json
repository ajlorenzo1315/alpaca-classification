(Electrical and Electronics Engineering) Birla Institute of Technology and Science - Pilani, India, 1981 Research Interests: Instruction-level parallel (ILP) processing Compiling for ILP architectures Shared memory multiprocessors Memory Systems Research Summary My current research focuses on the design of the highest performance uniprocessors of a current generation. A target that we have set for ourselves is to sustain the execution of over 10 instructions per cycle, for ordinary non-numeric application programs. The bulk of my group's research effort is expended in continuing the development of the Multiscalar processing model, a novel paradigm for exploiting ILP. Currently we are developing the Multiscalar compiler, and carrying out detailed simulation studies to assess the potential of the Multiscalar concept.
