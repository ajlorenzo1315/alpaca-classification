The virtual camera is a set of transforms which takes a 3D representation of a set of objects and arranges for them to be shown in a 2D window. For a virtual camera we will need to specify where the camera is, where it is pointed, the width of the field of the camera, and perhaps other parameters which a real camera cannot have (e.g. clip planes, or variable aspect ratio). To do this, click on each of the filenames shown below. The other is controlled by a Camera and Display module. The Camera module gives you explicit control of the viewing parameters. Whereas the image module always points at the scene (by default), an explicit Camera can point anywhere you want and can be controlled by the program itself. On the control panel, switch the selectors to the Animate position and run the sequencer. The position of the Camera (the \"from\" parameter) and the up direction are now a function  of time. Use these interactors to orient the TV camera in space and to control a Camera module to produce the image the TV camera would see. Put the image on the front of the modeled TV as shown in the image below. You will need to convert the control interactors into rotations and translations of the TV camera. Your program does not need to show the recursive image if the camera happens to be looking at the TV screen. It is more important to be able to control the camera in space and show the resulting image than to make a fancy TV set or camera model. Be prepared to demo your TV program  during section for a maximum of 15 minutes. You will be graded on the correctness of the camera control and the readability of the program. You must document your code! Back to Main Page Go to Lab 5 Last modified, 2/23/96, B. Land. Copyright Statement",
