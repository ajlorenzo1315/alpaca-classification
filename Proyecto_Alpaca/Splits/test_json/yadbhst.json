As you may know, I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Harvard University (one of the Ivy League ). So far, it has been a lot of fun. For a little while I was part of the 'real world' which was after being a student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT. I spent many years at the Institute; getting my Masters in '95. Once i finish all this schooling, I would like to go to the beaches of California for a long while, learn how to surf, become a beach bum and work on a tan. My academic and research interests include computer networking , parallel computer architectures , distributed computing , operating systems and the internet . But I am very interested in management and business . In the future, i see myself combining both roles of an engineer and a manager. But, we shall see about that. Outside of school, i am engaged in various activities. I participate in many graduate teams at Dudley House including soccer, ultimate and volleyball. I am also a non-resident tutor at Leverett House which is one of the undergraduate dorms. When i have a chance, i ride my bike along the Charles River in Boston , read a newspaper or even watch some television . By far, my favorite place is San Francisco . The weather is just unbelievable. I hope to be able to travel to many more parts of the US and actually start on Europe . It was named for the French Hugenot immigrants who came from La Rochelle. You are visitor since October 30 1996. Hany Saleeb / saleeb@eecs.harvard.edu",
