Our interests span the spectrum, including problems of visual, functional and object-oriented languages as well as mainstream languages like C and Our emphasis is on practical and experimental work rather than theory. Specific interests of group members are the structure and applications of visual languages (Citrin), methods for improving the performance of object-oriented languages (Grunwald). A long-running project is concerned with providing executable specifications for the entire compilation process and automating the production of the compiler from them (Waite). Major Funded Research Projects The main funded research projects in this area include: High performance environments and languages -- funded by ARPA and carried out in cooperation with Indiana University and the University of Oregon Completely visual programming languages and environments - funded by the Colorado Advanced Software Institute (CASI) and US WEST Technologies. See VIPR for more information. Currently these include: ATOM -- A program instrumentation tool that supports detailed measurements of program performance for both user code and the kernel. The Eli System -- A domain-specific programming environment for translator construction. An object-oriented programming environment for construction of pen-based applications - including programming environments - on the Apple Newton Messagepad PDA. A C++ environment for the Newton should be available soon. Relevant publications R. W. Gray, V. P. Heuring, S. P. Levi, A. M. Sloane, W. M. Waite. U. Kastens, W. M.
