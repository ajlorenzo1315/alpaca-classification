    "Cuerpo": "I'm currrently a sixth-year PhD student in Columbia University's Department of Computer Science working under Prof. Peter Allen . My primary research interest is in the field of sensor planning in an active robot work-cell. I do some work in computational geometry, (right now) mostly concerned with the efficient computation of the volumes swept by moving polyhedra. This is part of the sensor planning work. Another research interst is the development of large-scale distributed, object-oriented systems for, among other things, the control of large, multi-sensor robot systems with multiple planning components. The Manufacturing & Engineering Services group of the Manufacturing Technologies Department of the Alberta Research Council has provided a very nice description of Rapid Prototyping if you are interested in learning more about it. I'm a music lover. I also love dogs.
