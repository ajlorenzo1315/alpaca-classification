    "Cuerpo": "Mad Libs are probably best illustrated with an example. Here is a sample run of the Mad Libs program: Enter a Mad Libs file: test.mad Enter a number: 1127 Enter an adjective: slimy Enter a person's name: Joe Blow Enter an adjective: drunk Enter a verb: incinerate Enter an adjective: tranquil The reason is that our teacher, Joe Blow, is really drunk. One time, he even stopped right in the middle of class to incinerate a student! It wus truly a tranquil experience. The actual stories that will be processed by the Mad Libs program are stored in a separate text file. For example, the Mad Libs file, test.mad , used in the above example looks like this: Computer Science [a number] is a very [an adjective] class. The reason is that our teacher, [a person's name], is really [an adjective]. One time, he even stopped right in the middle of class to [a verb] a student! It was truly a [an adjective] experience! Your program should read the file (you can use the read_file function from Program 5), prompt the user for each of the words or phrases to substitute into the story, and then print out the story with the user's responses in place of the square-bracketed prompts. The first time through, just extract each prompt, ask the user for their response, and store the response in an array. Then go through the text of the Mad Libs file a second time, this time printing out the story, substituting the user's responses for the square-bracketed prompts. Recall that you can use the substring member function of the string class to extract portions of a string (e.g., to extract the prompts inside the square brackets.) Just print the story as it is given in the file, substituting the user prompts with the user responses. What to Hand In As usual, you will hand in the source code, along with the output generated for some test cases. These test cases are now available. Test 1 Test 2 Feel free to hand in any of the creative madlibs that you came up with on your own! mbirk@cs.wisc.edu",
