    "Cuerpo": "Please send correspondence to Alan Borning, borning@cs.washington.edu Women and minority students are generally underrepresented in computer science and computer engineering programs, and our program is no exception. Grades don't tell the whole story of course, but just for calibration, the average GPA of students admitted to Computer Engineering is about 3.8 and about 3.6 for Computer Science. Once students are admitted to the major, there is no further weeding out -- our intent is that all students who are admitted to the major should be able to complete it -- but it is nevertheless a difficult and demanding course of study. The tutoring program has since expanded to include women who aren't minorities as well. In setting up and operating the program we've received help from several other programs in the College of Engineering, namely the Minority Science and Engineering Program (MSEP), Women in Engineering (WIE), and the Engineering Coalition of Schools for Excellence in Education and Leadership (ECSEL). The tutor is a graduate student in our department, paid as a 20/hour week teaching assistant (the same as course TA's). We inform students who are eligible for tutoring about the program by e-mail, and sometimes by written letter when they first enter the program (since not all students are regular e-mail users when they begin the major). (Tutoring was available for any CS majors course, which meant that Derrick had to know a lot of different material.) One of the undergraduate women (who didn't use the tutoring program) expressed this concern to me -- while we haven't heard complaints from other students, it is possible there are such feelings. (The cost of the program is that for a TA for the academic year -- currently about $17,000.) Evaluation At the end of the first year, we asked Neetha Ravjee from the ECSEL evaluation group, with help from Gerry Gillmore of the Office of Educational Assessment, to design and carry out an evaluation of the program. The bottom line was that the program was very successful, as substantiated by both numeric data and the comments. We haven't requested a formal evaluation since the first one, but the feedback from the students, volunteers, and advisors indicates that the program is continuing to be successful. For example, one student recently wrote: I've been having a graduate student as my tutor for one of the cs courses i take ever since last winter. I got to know more in general the life being a grad CS student and my tutors have been giving me really good advice on what I could do in order to get myself better prepared for grad school. My tutors have been really helpful in my coursework. Maybe it's just me, but this kind of one-to-one tutoring works very good for me. It helps me also to see a different way of looking at a problem, and I also like to have somebody knowledgeable I can talk to about a class. Verbalizing a problem often half solves a problem for me. Finally, many of the graduate student volunteer tutors said they had found being a tutor a rewarding experience.",
