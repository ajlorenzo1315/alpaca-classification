Professor Gonzalez research activity has concentrated on the development of efficient exact and approximation algorithms for problems in several disciplines. In the area of computer-aided design of integrated circuits and systems , he developed efficient algorithms for component placement and wire routing for VLSI and MPCB systems. Specifically, he has developed efficient algorithms for channel, rectangle, and switchbox routing problems, via assignment, via placement, pin redistribution, and layer assignment for VLSI and MPCB systems. Specifically, he has developed some very interesting algorithms for partitioning, grouping and covering problems. These are robust algorithms that generalize to any number of dimensions. These problems have applications in computer-aided design, cluster analysis, etc. He has also developed efficient approximation algorithms for deterministic scheduling problems. These problems have applications in manufacturing systems as well as in task assignment in real-time multiprocessor systems. He has developed efficient algorithms for preemptive and nonpreemptive scheduling problems in open, flow and job shops, as well as in identical, uniform and unrelated processor systems. The is a fundamental problem that arises when executing program in parallel computer systems. His work has been published in the Journal of ACM , SIAM Journal on Computing , Information Processing Letters , Integration: The VLSI Journal , as well as in IEEE Transactions , Other General Theory Journals , Computational Geometry Journals , Operations Research Journals , Other Journals and Research Books , and Conference Proceedings . Professor Gonzalez is an Editor of IEEE Transactions on Computers . He has received the Outstanding Computer Science Professor of the Year Award in 1987 and 1994. Dr. Gonzalez current research interests are the design of efficient algorithms for multimessage multicasting in networks, scheduling in unrelated processor systems, component placement and wire routing problems with applications in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) of Integrated Systems and Circuits; and algorithms for partitioning, grouping and covering problems.
