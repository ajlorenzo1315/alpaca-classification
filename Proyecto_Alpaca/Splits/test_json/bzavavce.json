Good for engineering and scientific applications. FORTRAN-77 (1977 revision) is the standard and most widespread version. Why learn FORTRAN instead of C++/Pascal/BASIC/... Still widely used in engineering. Lots of existing engineering program libraries are written in FORTRAN. How to use FORTRAN on the PC's Click here Compiling Steps Source Program (.for) in Fortran sent to compiler Compiler translates Fortran into \"machine language with a couple of holes left\",spits out .obj file A program may be broken into lots of segments, so there may be other obj's around. Inside the Computer Input: Keyboard,Mouse Output: Monitor,Printer Inside: CPU: Central Processing Unit. What does computations. Must put things in memory in order to run it. Machine code is very hard to read. Solution: Assembly language. Problem. Takes a loooong time to write out. You also have to worry about lots of details. Programmers noticed that many times there were sequences of steps that were repeated quite a lot, such as LOAD TERM %r1 LOAD TERM2 %r2 ADD %r1 %r2 %r3 STORE %r3 SUM Instead, it'd be nice to just say SUM = TERM1 + TERM2. This is a Fortran statement which is  translated (compiled) into those assembly instructions you see above. Copyright © 1996 Modified from Jeff Lampert ( tick@cs.wisc.edu ).
