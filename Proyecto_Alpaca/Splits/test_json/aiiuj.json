Course Description This is a course about parallel and distributed computing. Our approach will be based on an object oriented model of parallel computation. We will begin with basic parallel machine and algorithm analysis. Then we will move quickly into implementing these algorithms in an experimental library for parallel program design, called HPC++. We will be involved with the implementation of this library, so students will all be required to have an extensive background in C++. Topics include: Basic theoretical background of parallel algorithm design. Parallel programming on distributed memory multicomputers. Parallel Object Oriented Computing. Distributed Computing: CORBA and Nexus. Compilation technology for automatic parallelization. Recommended Kumar, Grama, Gupta and Karypis Introduction to Parallel Computing: Design and Analysis of Algorithms Benjamin, 1994 Syllabus Week 1\tParallel computer designs and models. Week 4\tRelaxation algorithms and simple linear systems. Week 4\tDivide and conquer: searching and sorting. Week 6\tMPI Week 7\tSP2 systems programming. Week 8\tHPF Week 11\tDistributed Computing: CORBA Week 13\tDistributed Computing: Nexus Week 14\tCompiler analysis. Week 15\tParallelizing program transformations Assignments Assignments will be given each week. Normally these will be due the following week. Some of the assignments will be large programming projects which will be given longer periods of time.
