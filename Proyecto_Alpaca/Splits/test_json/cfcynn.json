    "Cuerpo": "My research interests lie in two main areas:  database system performance and next-generation database systems. In the next-generation database system area, I have been involved in the EXODUS extensible DBMS project;  I am now involved in SHORE, a project aimed at developing a scalable repository for the storage and sharing of persistent objects in a heterogeneous environment. I am now working at the IBM Almaden Research Center (the source of a number of of the papers that I've been teaching to my students for the past twelve years). Garlic is an effort to build a heterogeneous multimedia information system that allows data living in a variety of repositories to be queried and manipulated as though it resided in one, homogeneous, object database. of the ACM Int'l. on Object-Oriented Programming Systems, Languages, and Applications (OOPSLA) , Austin, TX, October 1995, to appear. 1995 IEEE Workshop on Research Issues in Data Engineering (RIDE-95) , Taipei, Taiwan, March 1995. of the ACM Int'l. on Object-Oriented Programming Systems, Languages, and Applications , Portland, OR, October 1994. \"Towards Automated Performance Tuning for Complex Workloads\" (with K.
