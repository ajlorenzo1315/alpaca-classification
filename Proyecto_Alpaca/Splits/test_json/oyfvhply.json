University of Iowa Computer Science Research Index . A Quote \"I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in computing. We began to feel as if we really were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines. I don't think we are. Above all, I hope we don't become missionaries. Don't feel as if you're Bible salesmen. The world has too many of those already. Don't feel as if the key to successful computing is only in your hands. What's in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence:  the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more.\" Alan J.
