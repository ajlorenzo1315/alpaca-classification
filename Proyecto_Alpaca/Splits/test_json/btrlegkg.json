    "Cuerpo": "Issue: Should the student's registration home page contain a weekly class schedule? Undergraduate students are typically taking four or more classes, each of which may have several possible sections. Graduate students take only two classes, and Ph.D. students in their research phase may take none at all. For graduate students, it is easy to detect and avert scheduling conflicts. Position (Chosen) : Yes. Stakeholders UGRAD1 This second-year CIS student describes the complexities of undergraduate scheduling when required classes are scheduled at the same time. (total time: 2:21) video , audio , transcript More details of the above conflicts. (total time: 1:36) video , audio , transcript His view of the most useful addition an on-line system could provide for planning registration. (total time: 0:52) video , audio , transcript He doesn't feel he would have much use for a feature which allows him to see which classes are available for a given time slot. (clips not available) video, audio, transcript Conformance to Existing Standards The current Schdule of Classes contains a worksheet for the students to plan out their weekly schedule of classes. Position (Not chosen) : Don't care. Stakeholders The following are graduate students. Note that there is a difference between the needs of the Ph.D. student and the Master's student. GRAD1 A Ph.D. in research phase of his study, this student has no courses he is required to take. Due to his open schedule, time conflicts never occur for him. video , audio , transcript (first year of Master's program) video , audio , transcript , photo Design Decision: The student's home page will show the schedule for all the classes he or she has registered for. There is only one schedule, and that only shows classes which the student is formally registered for. While the student is permitted to register for multiple classes in the same time slot, only the first such class is displayed on the schedule (the student will see the other class in the list of registered classes at the top of the registration home page). This compromise was the best implementation we could do given the limitations of Mosaic. Return to Prototype (temporarily disabled)",
