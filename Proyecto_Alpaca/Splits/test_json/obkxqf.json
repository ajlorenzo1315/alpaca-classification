    "Cuerpo": "I am currently interested in constructing a search engine for images, using some new methods we have developed. Students I work with PhD students Jing Huang , Vera Kettnaker and Olga Veksler. I also spend a fair amount of time with various undergraduates, principally Greg Pass and Justin Voskuhl . Other undergraduates include Scott Cytacki, Justin Miller and Rob Szewczyk. Publications Most of these publications are available in postscript or in PDF (acrobat) format. Free PDF readers for a variety of different architectures are available from Adobe . Histogram Refinement for Content-Based Image Retrieval , Greg Pass and Ramin Zabih. Sarasota, Florida, December 1996. Comparing Images Using Color Coherence Vectors , Greg Pass, Ramin Zabih and Justin Miller. Fourth ACM Conference on Multimedia. Boston, Massachusetts, November 1996. Feature-Based Algorithms for Detecting and Classifying Scene Breaks , Ramin Zabih, Justin Miller and Kevin Mai. San Francisco, California, November 1995. Third European Conference on Computer Vision, Stockholm, Sweden, May 1994. Teaching I am currently teaching CS100B , an introduction to computer programming. In the Spring I will teach CS664 , a course in computer vision. If you are interested in that course, there are scribe notes from my lectures available on the web page. Professional Activities I am on the program comittee for CVPR-97 , the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, which will be held in San Juan, PR in June 1997. I am also on the organizing committee for the IEEE Workshop on Content-based access of Image and Video Libraries , to be held in conjunction with CVPR-97.
