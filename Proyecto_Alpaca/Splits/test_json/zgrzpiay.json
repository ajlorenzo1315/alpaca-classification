You must do this through the Project menu...you cannot do it through the File menu. My program source file has a \".c\" extension and the Borland compiler complains when I attempt to compile it. The easiest way to fix this problem is to select the source code file name in the project window (you will know it is selected because it will be highlighted). If you have saved the program source file with the \".c\" extension, you will want to resave the file with a \".cpp\" extension.

Input/Output Errors I'm trying to do a \"cin.getline\", but it's not working. When I run the program, it just goes right by the getline as if it weren't there. There can be problems when you mix \"cin >>\" and \"cin.getline\" input statements in a program. When I ran the program the first time, it worked great, but now when I run it I get the same output as the first time, no matter how I change the input. To find out if you do have the output file open, choose the Window menu. If you are also redirecting the input, you want to check to make sure that you have the path name to the file typed in correctly. In one window, you can use the editor to work on your program. The first is that the print server is not working. After you log in (using your login ID and your e-mail password), from the menu you can select to forward your e-mail. If you don't have this box selected, when you check your e-mail from the 1370 lab, it will download all of the mail in the mailbox to your user directory. This means that you will not be able to check that e-mail from anywhere else.",
