    "Cuerpo": "Finally, since our protocol is based on the World Wide Web, we also describe some of the problems we've observed in using it, in the hope that others at this conference will have solutions we can adopt. Dienst provides a uniform protocol for document access Dienst is a protocol for search, retrieval and display of documents. Messages may be addressed to every document server, to a particular server, to one document, or to a particular part of a document. The others used by programs, in particular other Dienst servers, but also by other digital library or publishing systems. Repository servers store documents in multiple formats A key difference between Dienst and other current digital library systems is its ability to represent documents in multiple formats. For example, if one wishes to do full text indexing on a document collection, the plain text is  more useful than the PostScript file, and if one wishes to display just a single page, a collection of page images may be better than searching through PostScript. The Dienst protocol includes a message that requests a document for a list of formats in which it is available. This server will display a form for searching the collection. The results from a search are displayed as a list of the DocID, author, title, and date for each matching document, and include a URL for each document. When this is the case, the user interface service is able to display the document page at a time, inline on the user's Web client. The server also allows the user to download and/or print all or selected pages of the document. Since all documents are not available in PostScript, the server has the ability to translate from TIFF images to level 2 PostScript on the fly. Our approach is to allow authors to use their traditional text production system - LaTeX, troff, Word, etc - and then provide tools by which they can submit the results of that text processing to a digital library Dienst simplifies digital library maintenance Digital library technology will only propagate beyond the technologically savvy if such systems require minimal human intervention, especially by trained experts. We recognize that there will be documents that can not be represented in this fashion, but estimate that there number will be very few and that techniques for managing them can be developed as the process matures. The shortcoming is that HTML, HTTP, and Web browsers lack a number of features important for digital document display and navigation. The only facility for multi-format documents is the ability to embed images (either GIF or X Bitmap) in an HTML document. First, Dienst provides a uniform protocol for search, retrieval, and display of documents. Second, Dienst provides a set of tools that permit easy management of a digital library. This work was done at the Design Research Institute, a collaboration of Xerox Corporation and Cornell University, and at the Computer Science Department at Cornell University.
