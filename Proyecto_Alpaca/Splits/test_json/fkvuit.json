A message regarding the details of the final will be sent today and a copy will appear on the newsgroup. Merry Christmas. Table of Contents Course Overview Prerequisites Course Staff Course Venues and Times Textbook Information Relevant Course Links Syllabus Handouts Course Overview This is a basic course on the design and analysis of algorithms. The course will focus on both general classes of algorithms, such as dynamic programming, divide and conquer, and greedy methods; and advanced data structures, such as balanced trees, graphs, and heaps. In addition, a solid background in mathematics will prove invaluable for this course, in that we will argue formally about the correctness and performance of almost every algorithm and data structure introduced.
