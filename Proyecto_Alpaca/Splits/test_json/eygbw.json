    "Cuerpo": "nat., Munich Institute of Technology, 1966 My interests are in programming methodology, in particular the formal development of programs, and in related areas such as programming languages, programming language semantics, and logic. I am as interested in the teaching of these topics as I am in further research in them. In fact, understanding how logic and formalism can be taught as a useful tool at the freshman/sophomore college level has been an overriding concern of mine in the 1990's.

I received a B.S. Queens College in 1960 and went to work for the U.S. We went to Illinois for more education. I received a Masters degree in math from Illinois in 1963. I was an assistant professor of Computer Science at Stanford from 1966 to 1969. What made it more exciting than usual was that they were born on the birthday of myself and my twin --26 April. We left Stanford because it had no weather. Return to table of contents I am better known for my text writing and my contributions to education than on the wonderfulness of my research. Do what you are good at; bloom where you are planted. I have received a number of awards for contributions to education: the 1994 IEEE Taylor L. Booth Award, the ACM SIGCSE award in 1991, a Cornell Outstanding Educator Award in 1990, the Clark Award from Cornell's College of Arts & Sciences in 1986, and the American Federation of Information Processing Societies' (AFIPS) education award in 1985. I am proud of all my Ph.D. advisees, but two stand out. And T.V. Raman's thesis just won the ACM best-dissertation award for 1993-94. Reading for the Blind is already using his system to produce audio cassettes. One year, it required only 256 telephone calls to get the 150 departments to send in their questionnaires. I received the Computing Research Association's 1991 Service Award for this work on the Surveys and for chairing the Association during its move toward respectability and responsibility.",
