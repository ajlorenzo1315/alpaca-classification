DIPCS (Distributed InterProcess Communication System) is distinguished by its use of a new distributed process group model and its ability to allow a spectrum of quality of service requirements to co-exist within a single call. These policies support the end-to-end delay and synchronization requirements of each connection. DIPCS provides a call model and connection management system that is scalable to a Wide Area Network. Multimedia Routing Algorithms Using the DIPCS call specification and network architecture I have developed both centralized and distributed multimedia routing algorithms. These algorithms are based on a mathematical model of the network and of the real-time requirements of multimedia traffic that predicts the probability of a route or set of routes being able to support the traffic specification. These algorithms have two parts. In the first part network performance is decomposed into a set of independent link evaluation problems. A link blocks if it cannot support the performance requirements of a new connection while maintaining support for existing connections. My analysis allows the link blocking problem to be determined by knowledge of only the traffic arrival rate and performance requirements. The second part is a route assignment and optimization phase. I have explored several methods for doing the optimization. My approach encodes the problem as a tree. Based on the problem instance I use domain-specific knowledge for initialization. Finally, I have developed an optimization algorithm which can be implemented in distributed or parallel fashion. This approach has produced quite encouraging results for real-time multimedia routing. Simulation results show that the blocking model coupled with an evolutionary computing approach to routing assignment optimization is very successful. Multimedia MedNet My research has found practical application in Multimedia MedNet. MedNet's initial goal, the development and implementation of a distributed real-time multimedia system for remote monitoring of and collaboration during neurosurgery, has been achieved in part through work that I began at Hewlett-Packard labs and continued at the University of Pittsburgh. As the lead technical person I have produced a significant amount of software, including real-time audio and call control programs that are part of the DIPCS system.",
