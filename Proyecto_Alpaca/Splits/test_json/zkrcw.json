    "Cuerpo": "His research is also driven by the future heterogeneous SMP and distributed systems infrastructure experienced in commercial and research settings -- the Distributed Laboratories project is constructing a heterogeneous computing environment consisting of ATM-networked uniprocessor and SMP machines, jointly offering the computational power and interconnection bandwidth of modern supercomputers. The HPPCEL Laboratory for experimentation with parallel applications is undertaking the development of several sample, large-scale parallel applications jointly with end users ( atmospheric modeling, finite element codes, fluid flow applications). In each case, these `applications' not only consist of specific computational tasks, but also include online analyses being performed for these computations and real-time visualizations of program data and monitoring of performance information, all of which are executed simultaneously such that end users can inspect program results and steer program executions to gain experimental insights. Prof. Schwan's primary contribution to this effort concerns the construction of a distributed laboratory for experimentation with high performance numeric computations for applications in molecular physics, atmospheric sciences, working with high performance atmospheric and pollution modelling, and manufacturing systems. These technologies are concerned with ``middleware'' software that will be directly utilized by distributed laboratory applications and described in more detail below: The Falcon project is studying the dynamic monitoring, adaptation, and interactive steering of high performance computations for on-line control of ``virtual laboratory instruments'' and for ``what-if?'' The COBS project is concerned with the distributed systems and communication technologies underlying distributed laboratory applications. The emphasis in distributed systems research is on support for shared-state in multi-granular and distributed computing environments. Prof. Schwan's current research addresses three basic research topics addressing the computational requirements and underlying hardware systems presented by the HPPCEL and Distributed Laboratory efforts: programming support tools, operating systems, and communication protocols. Steering may be defined as: Program Steering - A program that can interact with human users during its execution, where the purpose of such interactions is the use of on-line program information to affect or `steer' program execution. Using programming extensions of FALCON now under development, program tuning is performed graphically, as well, by explicit manipulation of parallel programs displayed as hierarchical sets of related objects. Its extensions toward `Configurable CThreads' address the on-line monitoring and configuration of high performance parallel programs, ranging from the rapid adaptation of individual program abstractions to user-directed program steering. Specific examples of configurable abstractions constructed with the CThreads basis include (1) adaptable multiprocessor locks able to improve program performance by adapting lock characteristics to program behavior during program execution and (2) adaptable communication protocols The DSA (Distributed Shared Abstractions) library for construction of distributed objects is available on shared and (in a prototype version) on distributed memory machines, including networks of workstations. The Kernel ToolKit (KTK) is a substrate for parallel programming and for the development of multiprocessor operating system kernels. For such systems, a benchmark application being developed by our group is able to emulate the behavior of video delivery systems and of more dynamic systems like those GIT-CC-94-29 PORTS: Experiences with a Scheduler for Dynamic Real-Time Systems Authors: Kaushik Ghosh , Richard M.
