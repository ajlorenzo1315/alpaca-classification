    "Título": "CODE Visual Parallel Programming System",
    "Cuerpo": "-- Alfred Lord Tennyson CODE is a visual parallel programming system, allowing users to compose sequential programs into a parallel one. The parallel program is a directed graph, where data flows on arcs connecting the nodes representing the sequential programs. The sequential programs may be written in any language, and CODE will produce parallel programs for a variety of architectures, as its model is architecture-independent. Click here for a screen shot . The newest version (pre-release available below) supports the Cray , Sun SMPs, and MPI . Announcements (11/14/96) A pre-release version of the new CODE is now available (and it's FREE)! Click here to download the software. This is a major new revision of CODE (click here for a screen shot ). It features a sophisticated new user-interface which provides many improvements to the previous version of CODE, making it easier and more pleasant to use. Some of the features include a Mac-like interface ( à la MacDraw), multiple windows for subgraph editing, a hierarchy browser and more. (10/8/96) Article on CODE: HPCwire , the on-line journal of high-performance computing, recently published an article on CODE entitled \"Visual Parallel Programming May Come of Age with CODE\" that they've been kind enough to let us reproduce here.

First name: Last name: E-mail address: Documentation & Publications These directories of compressed PostScript files are documentation for the previous version of CODE, but are being made available in lieu of new documentation, which is in the preparation stages. Despite the changes in the user interface, these manuals are still quite useful.
