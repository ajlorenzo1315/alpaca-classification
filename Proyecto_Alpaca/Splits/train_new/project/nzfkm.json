    "Title": "UW Dynamic Compilation Project",
    "Body": "Our approach to dynamic compilation strives for both fast dynamic compilation and high-quality dynamically-compiled code: the programmer annotates regions of the programs that should be compiled dynamically; a static, optimizing compiler automatically produces pre-optimized machine-code templates, using a pair of dataflow analyses that identify which variables will be constant at run-time; and a simple, dynamic compiler copies the templates, patching in the computed values of the run-time constants, to produce optimized, executable code.",
