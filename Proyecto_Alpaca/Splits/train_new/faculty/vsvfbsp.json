Vavasis and Y. Ye, ``A primal dual accelerated interior point method whose running time depends only on A '' ( click here ) P. Hough and  S. Vavasis, ``Complete orthogonal decomposition for weighted least squares'' ( click here ) S. Mitchell and S. Vavasis, ``An aspect ratio bound for triangulating a d-grid cut by a hyperplane'' ( click here ) T. Driscoll and S. Vavasis, ``Numerical conformal mapping using cross-ratios and Delaunay triangulation'' ( click here ) The QMG package I have recently completed a software project on mesh generation for the finite element method in three dimensions.",
