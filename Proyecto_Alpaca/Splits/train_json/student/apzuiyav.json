I could tell you what I was working on, but then I would have to kill you. Haven't really had time to work on a homepage as much as I would have liked. You might prefer the PostScript version if you plan on printing it. Academic Interests Generally I am interested in computers and how they can make my life better. That interest takes a lot of different forms. In this vein I worked at The Santa Fe Institute last year where I worked on evolving Cellular Automata (you can look at my homepage there to see what I was up to.) I am a member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union as well as the Association for Computing Machinery . Recreation I enjoy most outdoor activities, especially [rock, ice, mountain] climbing and taking pictures thereof . I just joined both this year. In particular I find Bridgeport Special (only availiable at their brewpub that I know of) and Pintail ESB, Full Sail Pilsner, Widmer Hefeweizen and Sierra Nevada Porter to be very pleasing. Travel I am planning to take a trip to South-East Asia , New Zealand , and Australia within the next year. Any advice/reccomendations appreciated. Web Resources Despite my rather feeble web page, I really do think that the WWW is a useful tool. HTML converters OneWorld/SingNet WWW and HTML Developer's JumpStation - ver 2.0 (21 Oct 1994) Composing Good HTML A nice essay by my friend J. Eric Tilton about writing HTML. html-helper-mode An emacs mode written by my partner in crime at SFI, Nelson Minar which makes writing HTML a bit less painful. Uh, if you are interested you can get my current bookmarks . You can also take a peek at my Gnus Adaptive Scoring Files if you like. I think that these are examples of nice simple ways that people can share knowledge.
