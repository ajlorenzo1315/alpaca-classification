    "Cuerpo": "The main objective of my current research is to analyze how interorganizational relationships are mediated through OI resource use. Our Cooperating Organization on the IRIS Project is Knight-Ridder Information. Well, the net result of this is that I'm excellent in C, C++ and SQL. And I have wonderful war stories about trying to get multiple clients to work with multiple servers in widely distributed client/server configurations.)
