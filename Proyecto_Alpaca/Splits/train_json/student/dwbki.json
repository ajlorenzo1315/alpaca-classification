    "Cuerpo": "There are three sections to this page: My Undergraduate Thesis , a few sound Modules I've written, and a list of links through which I can share some of my interests. I'm fortunate that I had the chance to make all my mistakes in undergraduate school...I think I'll get my chance to do a thesis correctly now that I'm a Ph.D. student at UCSD. There are a few major flaws with this, and I think I ought to let y'all know what they are before you dive in and download these two files. Also, along with the lack of research, the paper has a very poorly designed \"related works\" section. In fact, I owe quite a lot to the Renaissance guys (Tran and Daredevil) for making the PMODE/W header the executable uses, and to MikMak of Hardcode for the MikMod routines I used. So, anyway, here it is. A zipped PostScript version of the actual paper. Here are some songs I've done in (close to) the order I did them...all are in either S3M or XM format. This has some of the better samples of the lot. I still like it, even after all of these years.... I still am not too fond of this one, but there are a shockingly great number of people who really love this song. I like the oboe patch for the GUS--you get 12 samples for the price of 9k. Got second place in one of the original 20-minute chiptune compos. This is the first song I've tracked to come close to the quality of my MIDI work. This song was the last song I released on a pHluid music pack. I didn't like it at first, because it was hastily completed; however, I'm beginning to realize that it takes my music in a direction I'd really like to go. The example song from my thesis, but with transitions written by me. The three songs which most people seem to like of these are Seizure, Pain II, and Insanity. For people, like me, who are homesick Longhorns. So if you want to sue somebody about something I've said, you're going to have to sue my poor ass.",
