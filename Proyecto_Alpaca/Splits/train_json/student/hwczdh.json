Box 0144 La Jolla, California 92097 Email : mabdalla@cs.ucsd.edu Biography Since 1988 I have been engaged in several research and teaching activities. The subjects of the courses were Computing I, Linear Algebra II, Infinitesimal Calculus III, and Differential and Integral Calculus II. In the period of 1990 to 1991 I was awarded a first research assistantship from a Sponsored Brazilian Research Institute to work at the Mathematics Institute. In my undergraduate senior year (1991 to 1993) I was awarded a second research assistantship to work in two Audio projects at the Department of Electrical Engineering at UFRJ, concerning the study of the electronic sound synthesis. In the middle of 1992, I took part in the Computer Network Research Group (GTA) at the Department of Electrical Engineering at COPPE/UFRJ. At This time I was involved in the study of the concepts of Computer Networks defined in the Reference Model for Open Systems Interconnection, and also in the study and development of formal description techniques. My undergraduate project consisted in the implementation of an integrated environment for Petri Net analysis, including the development of a text editor, a compiler, an analyzer and an on-line help. By 1993 I started to work in a system development company as a system analyst. course in the Department of Electrical Engineering at COPPE/UFRJ in the particular area of Computer Networks. the topic of my thesis was concerned with the study of Connection Admission Control (CAC) mechanisms for ATM networks such as Equivalent Capacity, Non-parametric aproach, Heavy-traffic approach, Dynamic CAC, Hybrid CAC, etc. The main objectives were to analyze and to compare the performance of these mechanisms by means of simulation and analitical analysis and to give support for an implementation in the real time communication system architecture developed by the GTA. By October 1996, I started my Ph.D. at the University of California at San Diego. My interest in realizing  a Ph.D. course is a consequence of the need of improvement of my academic and professional background. As in Brazil there is an urgent need for qualified engineers to maintain the country updated with the state of art of the new technologies, the realization of this Doctorate Course will enrich my research in Computer Networks and will contribute for the improvement of our courses in the graduate and undergraduate levels. - ``Controle de Admissão de Conexão em Redes ATM'', October 1995.
