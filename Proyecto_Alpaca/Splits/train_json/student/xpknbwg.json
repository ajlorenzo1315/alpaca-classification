I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay and an MS in Computer Science from the University of Virginia . Such equations are most commonly solved on a computer by approximating the derivatives using finite differences and advancing the solution forward in time using either an explicit or an implicit method. Explicit schemes have the advantage that each time step is very fast to compute. However, each time step is far more expensive in terms of computer time. Furthermore, the computation process is not easily parallelizable. In this thesis, we propose a new procedure intermediate between the explicit and implicit schemes described above. We retain the computational efficiency of the explicit scheme, and at the same time obtain a stability requirement that imposes an acceptable restriction on the length of the time step. However, the truncation error is of a form that again imposes an unacceptable restriction on the length of the time step. The new procedure is not as easily parallelized as the explicit method but is more parallel than the implicit method. We use the new method to solve the 1,2 and 3 dimensional Burgers' equation, which is frequently used as a model for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Details in Postscript format (these are incomplete drafts I'm currently working on) Numerical solution of conservation laws (169 K) Parallel numerical solution of Burgers' equation (643 K) Time Domain Parallelism Time dependent PDE's are often solved by parallelizing the solution process in the spatial domain. In this paper, we examine a class of algorithms, which incorporate parallelism in the temporal domain to increase efficiency. A Postscript version can be found here (133 K). It can easily be adapted to evaluate a wide variety of sequence comparison algorithms and shows close to optimal performance characteristics. I don't have a Postscript version :-( Other Technical Interests Check out Intel's fantastic P6 processor presentation . Lots of MPI stuff is here .
