I'm a PhD hopeful at: Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington. Here's a picture of the Spring 1996 Computer Animation class. Last quarter I completed my quals project: Run Time Code Generation under the Multiflow compiler. Way NE #206 Seattle, WA 98195-2350          Seattle, WA 98105 (206)543-5118                   (206)523-3713 My resume . I've written the following papers: Fast, Effective Dynamic Compilation , J. Auslander, M. Philipose, C. Chambers, S.J. Bershad. Eggers, J. Auslander, M. Philipose, M. Mock and P. Pardyak. Workshop on Compiler Support for Systems Software (February 1996) Further Experience with Controller-Based Automatic Motion Synthesis for Articulated Figures , J. Auslander, A. Fukunaga, H. Partovi, J. Christensen, L. Hsu, P. Reiss, A. Shuman, J. Marks, J.T. Ngo, ACM Transactions on Graphics (vol. 14 no. 4, pages 311--336) This paper also has a web site. \"Optimal Leapfrogging\", J. Auslander, A. T. Benjamin, D. S. Wilkerson. 66 no. Here is a (very lossily compressed) mpeg animation that goes with the motion synthesis paper. The last sequence shows my work: how the computer can piece together some cartwheels, a jump, and shuffle into an animation without having the figure fall down and collapse. Autumn '95 I took 557 and did the super-short animation, \"Bug\" (or try \"this\" double speed small version) for my final project. Until I find a better place for them, here are some slides from the talk on singular value decomposition I gave in the graphics seminar (590b). ausland@cs.washington.edu",
