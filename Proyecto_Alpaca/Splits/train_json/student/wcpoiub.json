My mother is now employed by FHP Health Care as an ultrasound technician. Both received bachelors degrees from the University of North Dakota at Grand Forks , my father in mechanical engineering and my mother in speech therapy. Nothing really eventful happened, except I almost electrocuted myself with a Christmas tree ornament in 1975. We spent six months in Montgomery, Alabama in 1974-5 and nine in San Diego, California in 1977-8. I have not moved from this area since then. I have attended a total of eight elementary and secondary schools, and so don't feel much attachment to any of them, even the high school from which I graduated, Laguna Hills High School in (guess where?) I've been through large parts of it on road trips with my family, though, and very much enjoy seeing the countryside instead of flying over it. I'm very glad that there are employment opportunities in the areas I'm interested in -- it's a shame when people have to work at jobs that they don't enjoy. However, I'd also like to work at a job where I felt I was making a difference in the world, and being a minion of the Borg doesn't fit with that ideal. I feel that I could make the most effective contribution in the field of OS design right now, because it's what I've been researching for almost a year now, but not many companies are deploying radically new operating system designs right now.
