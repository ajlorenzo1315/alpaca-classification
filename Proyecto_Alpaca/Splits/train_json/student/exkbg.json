His current research is in the area of Virtual Environments , working with Dr. Larry F. Hodges . Drew completed his undergraduate degree at the University of Virginia , doing research in Virtual Reality and User Interfaces as part of the User Interface Group . Current Research Activities: The Simple Virtual Environments programming library development A set of programming tools for easily creating a Virtual Environments Application, or a 3D visualization for flat screens or 3D glasses. Features a event callback mechanism to handle events and a hierarchical description of objects in the Virtual Environments or visualization. Multi-user Virtual Environments Currently exploring methods of allowing multiple users (or computer agents) to share the same virtual environment. Whole hand input to Virtual Environments We have examined device characteristics of the Cyberglove glove input device over a wide range of hand sizes to determine the capabilities of the device for hand input.
