Research Interests I am interested in the theoretical and practical ways to address fault-tolerant computing where  response time is critical. Traditional transactions have properties (ACID) which are useful for fault-tolerance, but traditional transactions are too expensive to be practical in many areas. Previous  light-weight transactions (e.g. group commit ) have addressed increased server throughput. Unlike traditional transactions, Lite-transactions do not commit to disk. Rather they commit to memory. In this case, the system is recovered from the last checkpoint. I have developed an efficient checkpointing algorithm for Lite-transactions which is non-blocking for clients and requires very little synchronization for servers. Linda may be used to harness the aggregate power of networks of workstations. However, Linda is not fault-tolerant and Linda processes can become obtrusive when a user finds her machine busy with someone else's processes and the Piranha system can only be used for a limited types of applications. We have a working prototype of a system called Persistent Linda where we apply lite-transactions to the Linda model. Persistent Linda may be used to harness the aggregate power of networks of workstations in an unobtrusive manner: processes are automatically killed (ie kill -9 pid) on one machine and restarted elsewhere. The fault-tolerance mechanisms built on lite-transactions allow processes to recover from their last commit point. Another project I am working on is to provide transparent shared memory, fault tolerance, and a runtime system capable of running efficiently on highly unpredictable networks (e.g. the WWW) for Java.
