    "Cuerpo": "The user would like to read all and only those portions of the text that are about predefined important features. My research addresses the problem of automatically locating text about these features, where the important features are those defined for use by a case-based reasoning (CBR) system in the form of slots and fillers. Using a case-base of annotations for each slot we generate and pose a query to an IR system that is aimed at the retrieval of passages within a relevant document. This research is done in conjunction with The Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval .
