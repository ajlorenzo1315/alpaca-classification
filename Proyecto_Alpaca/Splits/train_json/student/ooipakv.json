Lee Graduate Student, Computer Science Department , School of Engineering and Applied Science , Columbia University . Research Advisors: Dr. Moti Yung and Dean Zvi Galil Research Interests Network Security Electronic Commerce Firewalls and Proxies Cryptanalysis Key Escrow Cryptography As defined by Diffie and Hellman in the classical paper \"New Directions in Cryptography\", cryptography is the study of \"mathematical\" systems for solving two security problems: privacy and authentication. Topics in Cryptography include: Private Key Crypto Systems Public Key Crypto Systems Digital Signatures Pseudo Random Number Generators Probabilistic Encryption Secret Sharing Zero Knowledge Protocol Number Theory Kerberos Authentication Service Kerberos is an distributed authentication service used in a client- server environment where a trusted third-party service is used to verify the identities of users or clients. Kerberos was implemented at Project Athena at MIT in 1986. Specifications can be found in RFC 1510. In Greek mythology, Kerberos is the three-headed dog that guarded the entrance to Hades. It is also known as Cerberus in Roman. Kerberos appeared in Dante's Inferno. (Lit Hum finally pays off!)
