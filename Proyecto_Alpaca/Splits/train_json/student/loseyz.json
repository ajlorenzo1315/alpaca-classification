Hardnett The Home that Charles Built by Charles R. Hardnett \" A Panther in a Yellow Jacket \" My home page consist of the following topics : Education Research Personal History HomeLife Hobbies & Interests Business Resume Lectures for CS3411 Education I am a PhD student in the College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology . I am a member of the Parallel Languages and Environments group which is part of the Operating Systems group . PAT accepts a sequential FORTRAN 77 program, performs parallel program transformations on the source code, and outputs a parallel program that can run on target parallel machine. My research is predicting the performance of a parallel loop transformation vs its sequential version at compile time. I am currently developing an analytical model that can be used to study cache performance of shared memory multiprocessors. I hope that this will lead to a model that can be used to predict the performance of a loop nest or some other construct on that machine. Well, its really not world famous, but it is a popular mall for African-American retailers. This is my 4th year in the PhD program in the College of Computing , and my 3rd year working with Dr. Appelbe in Parallel Languages and Environments. During my career from '87( PVAMU ) to the present I have held various positions: Research Assistant at GT(this is my 5th year) Member of PhD admissions committee (1995-96) Graduate Student Senator representing the College of Computing Member of the Scientific Staff at BNR, Atl in Norcross Tutor for college level math and computer science PC Lab Administrator Field Service Engineer at Northern Telecom (INROADS/Atlanta Intern 87-91) Research Assistant at CalTech (Summer of '91) Back to Index Home Life I am married to a wonderful women, Felicia A. Powell-Hardnett. She is also a PhD student at Emory University in the School of Public Health studying Biostatistics. We do not have any children, but we definitely want to have them when we have finished school. Just like I'm king on microphone.....I like slam dunks and take-me-to-the-hoops, my favorite play is the alley-oop, I like tha pick-n-roll, tha give-n-go....

My wife and I like to visit the hot and not so hot spots that are a part of the Atlanta Nightlife Scene. We frequent all of the comedy clubs in town, and have had the pleasure of watching comics grow from amateurs to professionals(some of them even have their own show on TV!!!). I like to play games also. My wife and I like to do things together, and since she does not play Hoops; we work out at Ballys Health Club about 2 to 3 days a week.
