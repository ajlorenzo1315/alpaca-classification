Interest Description Music My CD collection comprises about 300 items. I have some preference for hip hop and my favourite record label is Talking Loud, but I would call my music taste pretty versatile. If you wanna listen to something really cool, I have two advices for you: Portishead and Guru's Jazzmatazz ! And just for your information - the split of Take That was definitely the best thing to happen in '96. In my opinion the 80s were a superb decade concerning music. And there's one musician I really would like to go to bed with: Lisa Stansfield ! Right now I'm taking a break since those stupid Americans prefer action packed sync swimming, golf, and turning into couch potatoes. My favourite team is SV Casino Salzburg , but they suck right at the moment. Rapid Wien is a fantastic team, too. And don't forget: there's just one genuine James Bond - Sean Connery! Once, I wrote a novel myself and I can tell you, it's damn hard to come up with something exciting. The funniest guy is probably Joseph Wambaugh , followed by Charles Willeford. The toughest author beside Vachss seems to be James Ellroy. There is a place in Salzburg called Gösser Stubn where all my friends meet each Sunday to have a couple of beers. The best bar in BG is BW-3. C ya there! You can catch a glimpse of it. Lounge This site is a tribute to all my friends back in Austria and to some I got acquainted with here at BGSU . I'd be pretty braindead without them!",
