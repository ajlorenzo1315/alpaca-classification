The objective of our work is to solve these problems, thereby enabling the parallelization of such codes. Our approach is to create a data dependence testing framework targeted towards program code involving dynamic, pointer-based data structures. To enable accurate dependence testing, the compiler must collect both information about the properties of the data structure (e.g. tree vs. DAG) and information about the memory locations being manipulated in the data structure. The former are represented as axioms about the structure, the latter as paths through the structure. Speedups were linear to near-linear on a shared-memory multiprocessor. Our work represents the first accurate and general mechanism for data dependence testing in the presense of dynamic, pointer-based data structures.
