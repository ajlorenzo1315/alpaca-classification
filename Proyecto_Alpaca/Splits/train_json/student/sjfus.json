If you plan to visit, here's a guide to plan your trip. And don't forget to travel by Indian Railways . After graduating in Production Engineering from Regional Engineering College, Tiruchirapalli, Tamil Nadu, South India and working for an Engineering Company in Bombay, the financial capital of India, I decided to go back to school for graduate study. That was 4 years ago. A Masters in Industrial and Systems Engineering from this same University in Oct'94 (Here's the proof of my graduation). Isn't that enough? My first friends in the US Being new to this country with a totally different culture it was really hard to make any friends. It was a year later when I met Mr. Brian Hall and Ms. Catherine Todd Boyles , my first good friends at Rutgers. Brian is with the Sociology department. He is a veteran at Rutgers, where he did his undergraduate and graduate degrees and is now in his doctoral program. never wants to leave school. He is a very good tour guide and showed me around Philadelphia and New York City. She hails from Pittsburgh, the home of the famous Hindu temple. She is very interested in foreign languages. Though not a German, she graduated with a Masters from the German department at Rutgers and specialized in translation. Her interests include studying languages, poetry, reading, sewing and of late, playing tennis. She is all excited about her new full-time job as a translator at Siemens and her upcoming marriage to Mark Klingler. Mark is a great artist at Carnegie Museum . Good Luck, Cathy!",
