So I will be unable to maintain this page for these last couple of days. However, I am putting this link to Dr. Porter's page and all class related announcement (if any) will be available by following it. Next week, there will be special classes for reviewing some of the important topics covered in class. However, notes will be posted on doors and the office and there will be someone in the office (PAI 3.06) to inform you. So, if you need any help, feel free to come by and ask one of us; we will be glad to help.
