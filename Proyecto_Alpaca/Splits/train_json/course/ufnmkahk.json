Instructor - Gareth Bestor Office: Rm. 1306 Computer Science & Statistics, 1210 W. Dayton St. Office Hours: Wed 7:45 - 8:45 am, Fri 11:00 - 1:00 pm or by appointment Phone: (608) 262-6601 [office] (608) 251-5193 [home, emergencies only ] E-mail: bestor@cs.wisc.edu (click here for finger) World-Wide-Web: http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~bestor/bestor.html Grading Policy Your final grade is based on seven programming assignments each worth 5% (not including Program #0) and three exams. You must complete and hand in all the assignments to be eligible to receive a passing grade for the course. Final grades for all CS 302 sections are graded on a curve with a mean in the range of 2.8 - 3.0, where A = 4.0; the curve is computed after the final exam is completed. Exam 1 Thur February 29, 7:15 - 9:15 pm Exam 2 Wed April 10, 7:15 - 9:15 pm, Rm. 1207 Computer Science Final Mon May 13, 7:55 - 9:45 am Click here to see a list of the current class grades (identifed by student ID only). You will only get the most out of this class if you read the relevant sections of the text before coming to class. This way you will be able to ask questions in class about anything that you are unsure of, instead of waiting until you're in the lab trying to work on an assignment to discover you didn't really understand something. Week 1 Week 2 Week 3 Week 4 Week 5 Week 6 Week 7 Week 8 Week 9 Week 10 Week 11 Week 12 Week 13 Week 14 Week 15 Exams and Programming Assignments There are three exams: two mid-term exams and one final exam. If you hand in a program that does not run or will not even compile without errors then it will not be graded and will automatically receive a zero grade and you risk failing the course.

Good problem solving skills distinguish a \"good\" computer programmer from a \"bad\" one - it doesn't matter how familiar or skilled you are in a particular programming language, if you do not understand how to solve the problem then you will not be able to write a computer program for it in any language. You should look at the problem and think about it during the week and right down the steps you would go through to solve the problem; i.e. the overall structure of your program. This is primarily an exercise in general problem solving so you do not have to write any FORTRAN code (though you may if you want to and have time) and your solution/algorithm should not even be dependent on a particular programming language such as FORTRAN. Each Friday we will go over the solution in class. Exercises: Week 3: Question 16, Pg. 329 (subroutines) - click here for the solution; Question 11, Pg.
