Cook, Princeton University Note: Course Meets in Small Auditorium (room 105) of CS Building, Not Room 103. First Meeting: Thurs. Sept 12, Noon For More Detailed Descriptions as The Syllabus Develops, see: San Jose State HCI Class Home Page Local Princeton Course Information Home Page This course presents computer interface design for engineers. There will be some lectures on the psychology of HCI, and on computer systems, but in the main, the course will cover the design and interfacing of input and output systems. The course will be paired with a laboratory that will guide the students through experiments of increasing complexity. The founding developers of the course concept (San Jose State University, CA) were awarded a National Science Foundation grant for the project. Participating institutions are the Naval Postgraduate School, UC Santa Cruz, UC Davis (at Livermore), San Jose State University, and Princeton University. Advantages of setting up the network are that expert lecturers at all sites can contribute to the course. Also, methods will be sought to share (over the net) some of the expensive equipment that is located at only one site or another. Additionally, students will be able to take the course at their respective institutions, engage in dialogs (ATM and EMail) with advising professors at the other institutions, and potentially work with students at other sites on team projects. Emphasis will be on developing interfaces with and for clients outside engineering, who will bring with them some need of an interface device that they want to see created. Issues of software for interfacing as well as accomplishing the desired tasks will be a focus. The laboratory segments will be taught with the aid of an Interface Design Workstation (IDW), which will be constructed using readily available hardware, and posses flexible input and output ports, so that students can connect (somewhat) arbitrary interface devices.
