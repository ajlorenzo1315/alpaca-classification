    "Cuerpo": "Course Description This course will view software engineering activities from a management perspective centering around a study of the software development process. Our approach is in contrast to the traditional software engineering course (such as the prerequisite for this course) which focuses on the techniques employed to accomplish technical activities. Topics to be covered include: software development paradigms (life cycles such as waterfall, evolutionary, incremental, and spiral), software process maturity (Capability Maturity Model and BOOTSTRAP Model), software process assessment and improvement, change management concepts, process and product metrics, organization and management strategies, and risk assessment. Although we will study several management topics, this is not a course in software project management. We will not cover how to manage people and resources. Participation in class activities, some individual activities, a term project, and a final exam will be required. Goals The goal of this course is to provide a systematic study of the software development process with an emphasis on how to define and manage it. After successfully completing this course participants will: be familiar with terminology used in this topical area have read and analyzed important historical and current literature addressing software life cycle models and software process issues understand the basic concepts embodied in the most prevalent software life cycle models, including knowledge of their advantages and disadvantages, and when it may be appropriate to use each life cycle approach be able to construct and represent a software life cycle for an organization or project be able to construct a project software life cycle that is consistent with a specific software life cycle model understand the factors that are important in building the capability or maturity of a software development organization be able to assess the maturity level of a software development organization understand factors that contribute to successful process change implementation be able to plan and implement a software process improvement activity Texts Mark Paulk, et al., The Capability Maturity Model:  Guidelines for Improving the Software Process , Addison Wesley, 1995. Alternate Resources If you are interested in additional information on this subject, the following list presents some resources that you may find useful. For this course you are not required to have access to these resources and a student without access to them will not be at a disadvantage in this course.

Participation All students are expected to make a regular contribution to the class. Off campus students should communicate with me on a regular basis using telephone, fax, or e-mail to comment on material presented in class, to provide feedback on industry/practitioner perspectives regarding topics studied, relate personal experiences relevant to class discussions, and of course, to ask questions. Assignments You will be required to perform a software process assessment and to make a report of your findings. You may evaluate a software development organization with which you are familiar or you may evaluate a case study I will make available. As a practical application of some of the course material you will be expected to develop a process definition/representation of a portion of your work function. The project is expected to be more extensive for graduate students than for undergraduates. For the project you might prepare a Software Management Plan following IEEE standards, develop a software process simulation model of your organization, or study software process metrics from your organization. Additional guidelines will be provided on each of these activities. You will probably want to keep a copy of all work that you submit just in case something gets lost in the mail.",
