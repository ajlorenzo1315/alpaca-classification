We start by examining in more detail the concept of recursion in Chapter 2 entitled \"Iteration, Induction, and Recursion.\" The same is true in computer science, and we next go to Chapter 5 to discuss special graphs, called trees, as they are used as a data model in computing. Chapter 9 presents a more general discussion of graph theory than the previous discussion of trees. Logic underlies all of computer science. If time permits, in the last part of the course we shall investigate finite state automata, a way of modeling computation. This material is is contained in Chapter 10. We shall also skip over many of the sections within chapters. This text is designed for a year-long course which introduces students not only to the fundamental ideas underlying computer science but also to the important data structures used in computing. In this course, you may discuss assignments with other students. If you are working with a group, please indicate it on your homework papers. Study Aids A template for ( regular ) induction.

Grading 40% Homework assignments and quizzes. Withdrawal May 24 is the last day (until 4:00pm) to drop a course or withdraw from all courses with an automatic W.  After that date, a student may withdraw only with the permission of his or her dean. Incomplete grade An incomplete (I) final grade will be given only by prior arrangement in exceptional circumstances conforming to university and departmental policy which requires, among other things, that the student must have completed the bulk of the work required for the course with a passing grade, and that the remaining work can be made up within 30 days after the end of the semester.",
