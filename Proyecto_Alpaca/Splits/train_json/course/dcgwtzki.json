We will give an in-depth coverage of basic geometric data structures, such as convex hulls, arrangements, Voronoi and Delaunay diagrams, flat and hierarchical triangulations, partition trees, etc. We will also survey several important paradigms of geometric algorithm design, including sweep line/plane methods, randomized techniques, cuttings and their applications, parametric searching, and various geometric optimization methods. We will motivate the material with example problems drawn from application areas such as robotics, graphics, vision, and geography, and discuss some of the non-trivial issues involved in implementing geometric algorithms robustly. Nevertheless, given some algorithmic preparation, we can cover lots of ground even in one quarter. Geometric fundamentals Computational primitives in two and three dimensions and their implementation; models of computation and lower bounds; geometric duality. Davenport-Schinzel sequences. Many-face problems. Proximity problems Voronoi Diagrams and Delaunay triangulations; algorithms and applications. Three-dimensional analogs. Partition trees and range searching The ham-sandwich theorem; decimation methods; range-searching problems of various kinds. Course mechanics: Class hours: Tuesday, Thursday, 1:15 - 2:30 in Gates 100 Text: The main text for the course is a reader, comprised of a number of survey articles plus lecture notes scribed with the help of students in previous years of this class. A second recommended reader is a preprint of the forthcoming book Computational Geometry by Example , by Mark de Berg, Mark van Kreveld, Mark Overmars, and Otfried Schwarzkopf. This book uses examples from application areas to motivate all the main structures and techniques of computational geometry and may become the main text for this course in future years. These two readers are available at the Stanford Bookstore. There will be no final exam, but there will be a midterm whose function will be to test breath but not depth. For the final grade we will count each of the homeworks and the midterm as 25% of the grade. Please do the homework --there is no other way to learn the material.
