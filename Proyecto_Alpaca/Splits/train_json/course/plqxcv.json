Click here for a course description. 1306 Computer Science & Statistics, 1210 W. Dayton St. Office Hours: Wed 7:45 - 8:45 am, Fri 11:00 - 1:00 pm or by appointment Phone: (608) 262-6601 [office] (608) 251-5193 [home, emergencies only ] E-mail: bestor@cs.wisc.edu (click here for finger) World-Wide-Web: http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~bestor/bestor.html Grading Policy Your final grade is based on four programming assignments each worth 25% (not including Program #0). This course is Pass/Fail only. You must complete and hand in all five assignments to be eligible to pass the course. 100% - Assignments (4 @ 25% each) Click here to see a list of the current class grades for Section 1 (identifed by student ID only). Syllabus (tentative) The following topics and sections of the text will be approximately covered each week during the semester. You will only get the most out of this class if you read the relevant sections of the text before coming to class. This way you will be able to ask questions in class about anything that you are unsure of, instead of waiting until you're in the lab trying to work on an assignment to discover you didn't really understand something. Week 1 Week 2 Week 3 Week 4 Week 5 Week 6 Week 7 Week 8 Programming Assignments There are four programming assignments each contributing 25% to your final grade. Click here to send me E-mail. Problem Solving Exercises One of the most important skills you will learn in this class is problem solving . Good problem solving skills distinguish a \"good\" computer programmer from a \"bad\" one - it doesn't matter how familiar or skilled you are in a particular programming language, if you do not understand how to solve the problem then you will not be able to write a computer program for it in any language. You should look at the problem and think about it during the week and right down the steps you would go through to solve the problem; i.e. the overall structure of your program. This is primarily an exercise in general problem solving so you do not have to write any FORTRAN code (though you may if you want to and have time) and your solution/algorithm should not even be dependent on a particular programming language such as FORTRAN. We will go over the solution in class the following Monday. Exercises: Week 2: Question 16, Pg. 329 (subroutines) - click here for the solution; Question 11, Pg. Computer Lab You will be using the Vectra lab in Rm. You may also work in any of the other computer labs on campus, however most do not have FORTRAN compilers (please see me first before using the CAE lab ).",
