    "Cuerpo": "Is this a \"Programming Course\"? The rest of the time will be for the purpose of answering extended questions and going into more specifics of some of the programming techniques and examples. If you don't have things to ask of me in this remaining time, I may ask some things of you (e.g. a quiz). You can get help on-line by emailing to cs60help@muddcs which goes to the graders/tutors and to me. If you do not want it to be attributed to you, please so indicate in your message. I or the tutors will explain to you how to work any problem, to any level of detail, if you ask. There will also be some assignments which you will not submit, but should do anyway because they will help you with other assignments. The languages for the graded assignments will probably be one in rex, two in Java, one in C++, one in Prolog, and one in assembly language ( ISCAL , for a simulated machine). Sufficient information about the languages will be provided to enable you to complete the assignments; you do not have to know these languages when you enter the class. Everyone will need to interact with a tutor, even if you don't need help: You will \"check in\" with your tutor on a regular basis, and show him/her your progress. Your tutor will make an evaluation of your work when you are ready to submit it, and recommend a grade to me. When properly setup the directory listing, obtained by ls -l, for this directory should look like: 2 drwxrwx---   2 yourid cs60         512 Sep  8 20:32 cs60/ If it does not, you should execute the following command from your home directory: chmod 770 cs60 The purpose of this directory is to be able to get help on programs without mailing the program. It is not necessary that you keep all of your work accessible there, just the things on which you are currently working. We observe the following Standard:  \"You may discuss the assignment with other students. In developing code for a programming assignment, you can discuss ideas with others, but discussion of ideas must not involve wholesale examination or transcription of the actual working code of others, with the exception that you may use any code explicitly provided by the instructor. The work of an assignment should be conducted in the week or weeks before, not on the last day when there is no space for the necessary thinking. After midnight on day N+1 work you spend on the problem is for you own edification only (which is not to say that it isn't worth doing or required; you just don't get points for it then). It is best to plan to get the assignments in on the stated due date. Programming in logic. The program will ask what assignment this is (a number), and then submit the assignment properly.",
