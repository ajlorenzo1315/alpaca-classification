Contents News Summary Lecture Information Text Course Schedule Grading Project Project Presentations Summary This course is intended to give you a broad exposure to advanced operating systems topics. I will assume that all students have had a good one-semester course on operating systems (CS 537 or the equivalent). Lecture Information Lecture: 11:00 - 12:15 Tuesday and Thursday, 1263 Computer Sciences Text There is really no satisfactory textbook for a graduate level operating systems class, so we will use a selection of 26 ``classic'' papers as our text. The course will be structured around readings from journal articles and conference proceedings. If you have a used copy, I can make available individual papers for you to copy. The lecture will not be a detail-by-detail review of the papers, but will instead be a discussion of major topics and themes using the papers a focal point. Grading There will be two exams (a midterm and a final) and a project. Project You will be required to complete a term project. A list of suggested topics will be provided, but you are strongly encouraged to make up your own project. Projects may involve implementation of tools, experimental implementations of algorithms suggested in the research literature, measurement studies, or simulations. All projects must have an experimental component. You will write a term paper summarizing the results of your project. This paper must meet the standards of a research publication. You will also make a short presentation about your project to the class. Project Presentations Here is the schedule for project presenations. All presentations will be in room 2310, Computer Sciences and Statistics. Times are approximate.",
