Algorithmic and Programming Language toolkits. What the course is about The course is intended to provide practice for participation in the ACM programming contest. The regional contest will be held on November 16th at several sites, this year Duke is a site. The top two teams in the region go to the world finals. We anticipate ten weeks of problems (with some time off for fall break and for the regional contest). Thus a total of 30 problems will be assigned. We will try to make one of the problems each week a challenge. The other two problems will be easier, but still require an effort to get completely correct. Grading Coded solutions will be graded on a scale of 0, 2, 6, 10. A 6 point solution solves some test files, but not all. A 2 point solution represents an honest effort at an attempt, but may not solve the problem for any test data. An honest effort is subject to interpretation, but we anticipate that it represents at least two hours of work. For group solutions, the points earned are split among the group members so that a perfect solution for a two-person group earns each person 5 points. Failure to present a solution will cause a 10 point deduction in total points. Students participating in the regional contest can earn points for problems solved in the contest. Turn in only one program for each group attempt.
