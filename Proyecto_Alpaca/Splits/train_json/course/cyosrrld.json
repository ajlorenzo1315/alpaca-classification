    "Cuerpo": "CS304P is designed to give you a firm foundation in Pascal programming, and so you will need to put some effort into it. Read this page and the Course Syllabus carefully. This page is only a summary of the Course Syllabus, which contains all the details of the assignments and other requirements as well as important policies, and the schedules of due dates, exams and other deadlines. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING IN THE SYLLABUS ! Hundreds of students take this course each semester, so it is highly structured. You are responsible for all the details. In any event, this course can become extremely difficult if you get behind. Due to the grading procedures, it is very risky to wait until near a deadline to take a quiz or turn in a program. Our apologies. Everyone attends the lecture by Suzy Gallagher every Thursday evening from 5:00 pm to 6:30 pm in Welch 2.224. You will have nine programming assignments that are written, debugged and graded in the Programming Laboratory . Note that laboratory hours are limited, and that grading hours are even less, and you are responsible for scheduling your work to fit within those limits. Note that Testing Room hours are limited and you are responsible for taking your quizzes before the deadlines. WARNING! There are often long waits for available proctors to grade assignments and quizzes for several hours before a deadline. You are responsible for submitting your programs and quizzes early enough to be graded. We will cover Chapters 1 through 14. You can use the newsgroup (utexas.class.cs304p) to communicate with the other students in the class. For example, you could form study groups. Many students also use it to gripe about this course.",
