News: Keep an eye on the course news for miscellaneous announcements. Sample Solutions: These will be linked through the assignments page. The final will be held on Thursday, Dec. 12 at 10:15 (it's a two hour exam). The final will not be in the regular classroom. It will be held in room 238 , down the hall. The approximate weighting of the work done is Homework Assignments 30% Programming Assignments 25% Midterm 15% Final Exam 30% Text: Weiss, Algorithms, Data Structures, and  Problem Solving with C++ , Addison-Wesley, 1995. A home page is available for the text. Following the \"Supplement\" link will lead you to C++ code for downloading. Aho, Hopcroft and Ullman, Data Structures and Algorithms , Addison-Wesley 1987.

Tentative Syllabus Week of Chapter Description Sep 30 5 algorithm analysis Oct 7 6, 15, 16 simple data structures Oct 14 7 recursion and timing Oct 21 11 stacks and compilers Oct 28 12 Huffman coding Nov 4 17 trees Nov 11 18 binary search trees Nov 18 18 AVL and red-black trees Nov 25 20 priority queues Dec 2 8 sorting Dec 12 Final Exam at 10:15 Thursday Late policy: All assignments are due by 5:00pm of the stated due date, though it is much safer to turn them in at class time. Late assignments will not be accepted once the graded papers are returned or once sample are handed out. Programming: should be done in C++. The programs have to be accompanied by a manual-like documentation page, analysis of program correctness and complexity, and evidence of experimentation that includes sample runs. Of course, if you have C++ available elsewhere, such as at home, you are welcome to use it. Grading: will be performed by an able and experienced grader. Any contested score will be first referred to that person. Note: to allow for a larger margin of subjectivity in grading, we will use the whole score range, from 0 to 100%; you may expect the average score (corresponding to B-) to be around 50%. The final letter grade will be assigned based on the total weighted score curve.",
