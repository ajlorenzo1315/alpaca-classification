We will be reading about and discussing such topics as protection, security, memory management, operating system kernels, file systems, synchronization, naming, and distributed systems. Please read the rest of this information sheet carefully. Text There is really no satisfactory textbook for a graduate level operating systems class, so we will use the current literature as our text. During each class, we will discuss topics relevant to the current papers. The lecture will not be a detail-by-detail review of the papers, but will instead be a discussion of major topics and themes using the papers a focal point. You will form reading groups with 2 or 3 of your classmates that will meet once or twice a week to discuss the details of the assigned papers. The readings are an especially important part of the class. So, the formula for being successful in this class is (1) read the papers independently, (2) discuss them in your reading group, trying to identify the important issues, and (3) participate in the class discussion of the papers. Class Discussions Class meetings will be in the form of discussion lectures. We will talk about the day's topics, and this discussion will be supported by your comments and opinions. If you are willing to participate actively and daily in class, you'll get a lot out of it. The first paper will be a design, based on ideas that you have read. You will work from some well-understood operating system facility and design an extension in some area. The second paper will involve a project, and the paper will be a summary of that project. Writing well will be as important as writing about good ideas. Each paper will be reviewed at least twice. The first reading will be a refereeing of the paper by one of your fellow students. The papers and reading will keep you busy. Grades Scores and final grades will be posted here as assignments are graded.",
