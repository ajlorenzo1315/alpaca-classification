A conference call between several parties that use both voice and video, and a playback of a recorded conversation are two examples of multimedia applications. For example, the bandwidth required for CD quality audio is very different from that required for full motion video, which is different from that of plain text. Optimal scheduling of real-time tasks on distributed and multiprocessor systems is an essential issue for multimedia applications. The objective of this seminar is to study the basic properties and techniques for real-time system support for multimedia application. Shin and P.
