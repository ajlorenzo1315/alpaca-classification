Here are some notes on the probabilistic election of a leader in a ring. Greg Hall has graciously agreed to make his C code for biomial heaps to everyone. Here are some additional notes on using this code. Here is a perl script which computes the closed form for a linear homogenous recurrence relation when you give it the roots and multiplicities of the characteristic polynomial. Jason Evans' instance generator for three processor scheduling is available via ftp. Solutions to homework one are available now. (Req'd) Computers and Intractability , Garey and Johnson. Freeman, 1979. Programming Project In this course, we implement three programs for the three processor scheduling problem. One uses a simple exhaustive search, another uses backtracking, and the third uses branch and bound. Here is a description of the criteria by which project papers are graded, and hints for getting a higher grade . However, these will be graded on a pass/fail basis, where students who turn in the homeworks and make a genuine effort will pass. Here are the homework assignments for this semester: Assignment Due Date Solutions One 2 Feb Here Two 28 Feb Here Three 8 March Here Four 15 April Here Five 8 May Here See the homepage from 1994 for past homework. Tests Here is Test One (with answers). The average score was 65.1 with a standard deviation of 20.5. The average score was 129 with a standard deviation of 15.5.
