    "Cuerpo": "The answer to all these is yes . The course will develop the theory of a number of neural network models. Design and optimization of discrete and continuous neural networks. Relationship to fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, and artificial life. Prerequisites: Biology 52 and Mathematics 73 and 82, or permission of the instructor. These assignments will constitute about 50% of the grade. The other 50% of the grade is from a substantial final project involving either a working neural network application or a research paper. The grade on the project will be determined by the comprehensiveness and degree to which you explored competing approaches. This book was used in the previous offering of the course. It includes topics such as radial basis function networks and temporal approaches which are not present in the main textbook. James A. Anderson, An introduction to neural networks , MIT Press, 1995. This is a more gentle introduction to the topic, by one of the pioneers in the field. The historical importance of this book will be discussed in the course. This book gives a broad look at pattern classification problems, but is not on neural nets as such. This book compares fuzzy and neural approaches to control problems. John R. Koza, Genetic Programming , MIT Press, 1994. This book focuses on the evolutionary approach to producing programs. This is a colllection of articles on the topic.
