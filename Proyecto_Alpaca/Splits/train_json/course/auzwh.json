Prerequisites: (CS Majors) Certified for upper division course work in computer science. Class Meetings: The schedule is a guide to the coverage of course material. In preparing for each class please read and study the appropriate material in the text. There will be self evaluation and assessment forms for you to complete on each reading assignment. Some articles from professional journals may be provided for reading. Other information sources: There are a number of excellent publications that provide access to contemporary writings in Software Engineering. A number of these are listed in the section describing the term project. Homework: There will be about fifteen homework assignment given in this course. Make sure your name is on the first page of the assignment. The exams will be given on the dates indicated in the course schedule. COURSE OVERVIEW This course will study some of the major problem areas in software development and will review, analyze, and apply many of the new techniques being used in the development of medium to large scale software systems. This is not a programming project course, but we will extensively study the software development process. Major topics to be covered include: Software Engineering Concepts & Historical Perspectives Software Life Cycle Paradigms Software Requirements Definition -- traditional and OO Software Design Methodologies -- traditional and OO Verification and Validation Software Quality Management Considerations in Software Development We will also cover topics of contemporary importance including, Software Quality Assurance, Total Quality Management, Object-Oriented Development, and Software Process Maturity. Most of these are available at the U of I library. Selected articles may be assigned for reading and study during the semester to supplement the text. A term project on an approved topic relating to a software engineering discipline is also required. Final grades will be determined by a \"curve\" based on class performance, but in no case will the curve be more severe than a standard (90, 80, 70, etc.) CLASS PARTICIPATION All students are expected to make a regular contribution to the class.
