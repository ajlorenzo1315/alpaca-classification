Hill and TA: Jeff Shabel URL: http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~markhill/cs752/ Computer architecture is the science and art of selecting and interconnecting hardware components to create a computer that meets functional, performance and cost goals. We will learn, for example, how uniprocessors execute many instructions concurrently and why state-of-the-art memory systems are nearly as complex as processors. Examining tradeoffs requires that you already know how to design a correct computer, as is taught is the important prerequisite CS/ECE 552. (The 1st Edition will NOT do, as there are many improvements.) Reader Students will also be taught to read the literature using about two dozen papers that will be made available as four readers through DoIT. of Wisconsin-Madison only): Introduction, Performance, and Cost (Chapter 1) Instruction Sets (Chapter 2) Caches (Chapter 5 Part A) Main Memory (Chapter 5 Part B) Advanced Caches (Chapter 5 Part C) Pipelining (Chapter 3) Instruction Level Parallelism (Chapter 4) Vectors (Appendix B) Rest TBD Project The default project is to do some original research in a group of three students. For example, you could examine a modest extension to a paper studied in class or simply re-validate the data in some paper by writing your own simulator. Alternatively, you may work in a group of two to write a paper that surveys an area within computer architecture. Assignment Examinations There will be two midterm exams, but no final exam. The midterms are listed in in the Approximate Outline. Homework There will be several assignments. Many assignments will require the review of material that is touched upon, but not covered in depth in class. The approximate weights of each assignment will be specified when the assignment is handed out. Assignments will be due in class on the due date. NO LATE ASSIGNMENTS WILL BE ACCEPTED, except under extreme non-academic circumstances discussed with the instructor at least one week before the assignment is due. Homework 0, Do NOT TURN IN, but you may optionally do it to refresh your knowledge (== Homework 1 from Fall 1994): assignment Homework 1: assignment and solution Homework 2: assignment and solution Homework 3: assignment Incompletes and Academic Misconduct University policy on incompletes and academic misconduct will be followed strictly.
