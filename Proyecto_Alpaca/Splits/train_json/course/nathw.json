Supplemental Books (on reserve in Math Library) Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest, Introduction to Algorithms , McGraw-Hill, 1990 Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman, Data Structures and Algorithms , Addison-Wesley, 1983 Requirements and grading Course grades will be based on ten (or so) homework sets, two midterm exams, and the final exam. The components will be weighted roughly as follows: Homeworks assignments         35% Midterm exams                 20% each Final exam                    25% Late assignment policy All assignments are due at the beginning of class. Policy on collaboration Homework and programming assignments should be done alone. It is reasonable to discuss general approaches to problem solution or algorithm design with other students but the bulk of the work must be done alone. Note on Language for Progamming Assignments Program source code in the book is in Pascal. However, for course programming assignments, you will be free to use your choice of Pascal, C, or C++ (or another language if approved by the instructor).

Code is not commented and does not quite meet the specifications for Question 2 (it reads the input interactively rather than from a file, handles only single character \"words\", and prints the tree in preorder rather than level order), but the important part, the one that fills in the table used to calculate the optimal binary search tree, is as it should be. Exam 2 solutions (HTML version). Exam 2 solutions (Postscript version). Sample exam in HTML Sample exam in Postscript Homework 3 solutions (HTML version).
