    "Cuerpo": "Multimedia technologies are finding more and more uses in computer applications and user interfaces. This seminar will survey the technology of digital audio signal processing (DASP) and computer music, and discuss several of the important topics in these fields. We will discuss the technology of digital sound representation, synthesis, processing, and recording, as well as topics related to virtual reality, multimedia tools, electronic games, and media data transmission. Participants will also have access to a range of software tools and WWW resources for optional on-line experimentation. The topics will include: -- digital audio signals and their representation; -- analysis/synthesis techniques and software sound synthesis; -- sound localization and the synthesis of localization cues; -- graphical representation of music on computers; -- media data storage, transfer formats, and file systems; -- the MIDI protocol and real-time interaction; -- music composition using computers; -- artificial intelligence, neural nets, genetic algorithms and music; -- object-oriented programming and music; -- real-time sound distribution on LANs and WANs; and -- unanswered questions and open topics. The seminar will be lead by Stephen T. Pope (stp@create.ucsb.edu), research director of the UCSB Center for Research in Electronic Art Technology (CREATE, http://www.create.ucsb.edu/), editor of \"Computer Music Journal\" (CMJ, http://www-mitpress.mit.edu/Computer-Music-Journal), and an active music composer and software developer.
