There are two important components of this course: reading and discussion of various research papers, and a project involving implementation of an experimental system. The research papers cover topics including synchronization and communications, memory management, file systems, protection and security, and distributed systems. The project requires you to choose a problem, research and propose solutions, and implement a prototype system. Lecture Info During each class, we will discuss topics relevant to the current papers. The lecture will not be a detailed review of the papers, but rather a discussion of major topics and themes using the papers as a focal point. Active participation in discussion is strongly encouraged. You can purchase these readings at the DoIT (formerly MACC) documentation desk for about $20. The readings this semester are different from those of previous semesters; so please do buy a copy of these papers. Grading There is no exam in this course. Instead, there are two assignments. The first assignment is using a benchmark suite to measure the performance of various operating systems (SunOS, Solaris, Linux, Windows, etc., as many as you can lay your hands on). The second assignment is the project, involving a project proposal, implementation, a final report, and a project presentation. Of the total grade, class participation counts 10\\%, the first assignment counts 20\\%, and the project counts 70\\%. Schedule Here is a tentative schedule . You can make up your own project as well. In either case, you need to come and discuss with me before choosing a project. Teams of two or more people are allowed. Slides Here are the slides I used in my lectures . Assigments Here is the first assignment .",
