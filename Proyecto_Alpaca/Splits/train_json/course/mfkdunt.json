Each time you use electronic mail, rlogin/telnet, ftp, or world-wide web (WWW/Mosaic) you've been using the TCP/IP protocols. We will spend time on each layer in the ISO protocol suite. network resources) transport protocols (TCP for reliable stream service, UDP for unreliable datagram service, VMTP for transactions and remote procedure call) performance (what factors influence the efficiency of protocols) internetworking  (transparently connecting networks of differing technologies) security and privacy (How can I be sure that President Clinton really sent this email message I just received?) application protocols: NFS, HTTP (WWW), SMTP (mail), etc. emerging Internet technologies: IPSec (Security), DHCP (obtaining IP addresses dynamically), CIDR, IPv6, etc. This is a \"hands on\" course and there will be both written and programming assignments. The projects included implementing a sliding-window data-link layer protocol, complete with checksums, timeouts and retransmissions; implementing both the client and server sides of remote procedure calls (using Sun's RPCGEN facility); and using the \"oracle\" name server to dynamically register network services allowing students to write their own client and server programs and invoke the services provided by other student servers (e.g. using BSD sockets). Warning: I will be updating the course this semester, and plan to cover some aspects of the x-kernel (as described in Peterson & Davie's book). Texts: \"Computer Networks: A Systems Approach,\" by Larry Peterson and Bruce Davie. Morgan Kafmann, 1996. \"Computer Networks,\" by Andrew Tanenbaum, (3rd Edition), Prentice Hall, 1996. \"Internetworking with TCP: Principles, Protocols and Architecture,\" by Douglas Comer, (3rd Edition), Prentice Hall, 1996. Class notes, which will be handed out during class (I expect to revise my old notes substantially). Background: The course will be taught at the introductory graduate level. C programming experience will be a plus, but is not required. (I may give 1-2 introduction to C programming assignments whose purpose is to introduce the language. Picking up C should be straightforward for those with a solid background in at least one conventional programming language such as Pascal. Note, however, that students are expected to learn C on their own time.) For more information, contact Thomas Narten, 254-7798, narten@raleigh.ibm.com.",
