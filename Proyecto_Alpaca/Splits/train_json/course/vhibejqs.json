    "Cuerpo": "References to such sources will be given in class at the appropriate time. The newsgroup for the class is utexas.class.cs380d . Required Textbook Distributed Systems , Second Edition, S. Mullender (editor), ACM Press, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Reading MA, 1994. Other topics, depending on time and interest, will be presented by me or by some of you (the size of the class does not allow all of you to give a presentation). Such topics  may include: distributed shared memory distributed objects kernel support for distributed systems weak consistency for replica management protocols for electronic commerce protocols for wide-area networks Grading There will be 4 or 5 written homework assignment. Any solution that demonstrates a credible effort on behalf of its authors (whether the solution is right or wrong) will receive a B or better. When there is such a collaboration, a single solution should be submitted for grading, with the names of the collaborators. There will be no final exam. A list of suggested topics will be distributed in class on Monday 4/8. The paper is due at the start of the last class, Wednesday 5/1: hence, you will have 4 weeks to complete the paper. You can also team up with a colleague and prepare one or two lectures on a topic not previously covered in class. If you choose this option, you and your colleague will only be required to write a single survey paper of about 20 pages. A precise proof is required when you are asked to ``prove'' or ``show'' something. To show that something is impossible, you have to give a proof that makes it clear that the problem cannot be solved, no matter what the algorithm is. Due: Mon, 5 Feb 1996 Problem 1 The snapshot protocols discussed in class and in the textbook assume that communication channels are FIFO. Derive a snapshot protocol for an asynchronous system that does not depend on the FIFO assumption, and prove it correct (i.e. prove that the protocol produces a consistent global state). Problem 2 Taking the snapshot of a distributed computation is a general technique for computing stable global predicates. In this problem you are required to derive such a ``specialized'' protocol for detecting a deadlock in an asynchronous distributed system.

The final exam The assignment constituting the final exam is due by 5 p.m., Friday May 3, 1996.",
