D IGITAL S IGNAL P ROCESSING D ESIGN L ABORATORY Prerequisite: #316. Architectural features of single-chip DSP processors will be introduced in lecture. Specifically, the arithmetic, memory organization, pipelining strategies, and the use of special on-chip hardware, e.g., multipliers, barrel shifters, will be emphasized. Specifically, the Tektronix 2642 Analyzer and the DSP Technology SigLabs are versatile multi-domain (time and frequency) instruments capable of spectrum, network, and transient analysis of real-time DSP systems working in the audio frequency range. In the remainder of this page, we provide an introduction to the course and the laboratory. Instructor Professor David J. Anderson Room: 4112 EECS Building Phone: 763-4367 e-mail: dja@umich.edu Teaching Assistant Ketan Patel xxx EECS Building Phone: 76xxx e-mail: xxxxx INTRODUCTORY REMARKS Grading : Laboratory     25% Lab Reports    20% Exam           20% Final Project  35% Laboratory : The structured laboratory segment will count for 25% of the total grade, based on participation and successful completion of the weekly exercises. Lab Reports : A report on each experiment is required by each group of two students. The reports need not be lengthy and need not be typed. The Exam will be open book, notes and lab reports. Final Project : You will be given a list of suggested project topics by the end of the second week of class. The project will typically be a design of a software or hardware algorithm for a real-time DSP system. You are encouraged to form teams of 4 to 5 students for each project (with a balanced distribution of SW/HW design skills in addition to the DSP algorithm expertise). Each group is required to submit a one-page Pre-Proposal by the end of the fourth week of class. A Final Project Proposal , based on the instructors feedback to the pre-proposal, will be due by the beginning of the sixth week of class. However, you are expected to show up during the regular laboratory time to demonstrate the current status of your project to the instructor or the TA. This will, hopefully, allow you to keep track of your progress towards your final goal. A final project report will be due by the end of the semester and a technical presentation will be scheduled shortly afterwards.
