    "Cuerpo": "Because there are not yet text books which emphasize Object-Oriented Programming in a first computer science course, we have written our own text, \"A First Course in Object- Oriented Programming.\" A teaching assistant who knows Pascal well will help with design and development of the coming assignment and answer any questions you have. Grading Points will be assigned for each program and exam, with programming assignments accounting for 25% of the grade and examinations 75%. 3       Variable and Constant Data, Types, Classes, Objects and Variables,      Chap 4 Method Calls, Function Methods, Conditional Expressions, You must attend one of these orientation sessions so that you will know how the computers work, what the lab procedures are, and how to complete the first lab assignment. You should bring them with you to Orientation, but it is not critical if you don't have them yet. However, the following rules are always in force, and you will be asked to leave if you break any of them: No accessing, copying or displaying of pornographic material No food or drink is allowed. A teaching assistant who knows Pascal well will help with design and development of the coming assignment and answer any questions you have. In the lab, the lab assistants will only check off assignments, answer brief questions about program syntax, and help you in using the computers. If you have time to do extra credit work, you have time to do an assignment correctly. However, don't let someone else write your programs for you, or you will be unable to pass the tests. Standard exams are used for all sections of CS 142. DO I LOSE IT? You won't lose it if you save it out to your floppy disk. It's a good idea to save your program periodically as you work even if you're not going to leave the lab. You will also need to get a copy of the CS142 and Turtles units from one of the lab TAs. If you have a Pascal compiler on it, you can use it to learn some things about Pascal. WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO SCHEDULE TIME IN THE LAB? The best way to learn Pascal (or any other programming language) is to write as many programs in it as you can.",
