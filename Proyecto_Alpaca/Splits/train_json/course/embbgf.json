It is intended to give students a solid background in the design and development of database management systems (DBMS's). This course forms essential background for anyone who wants to (a) become a systems engineer at a database development company, or (b) become an informed user of database systems, or (c) become a database systems researcher, or (d) develop systems in any domain that manipulate large amounts of data, or (e) find out how a teller machine really works! Although this is not intended to be an introductory course, it is a new course and there may be students in the class with different backgrounds. Development Project The term project is an important part of the course, and will involve a significant amount of C++ programming. The second goal is as important as the first one, because all database systems are huge software systems, and rarely do you have the luxury of starting from scratch. There are two research DBMS prototypes that will be used in the projects. One is MINIBASE, which is software associated with the textbook. The important part of MINIBASE is the interface description of the various system components. There are a number of possible projects (some of which could lead to research topics) that can be built on top of PREDATOR. If you think you are interested in database systems research, then you should do a PREDATOR project. There are also some general projects that involve neither system. In all the projects, there will be certain steps that should be followed: As part of the project proposal, you should (discuss with me) and submit an ordered list of pieces of functionality that the project will produce. The code you write must follow the coding conventions of the particular system that you are working on. Course TextBook The primary text is a beta edition of a new book on database systems : \"Database Management Systems\" by Raghu Ramakrishnan. This book contains many more details than are in most other introductory database books. It is also associated with free software for an instructional database system \"MINIBASE\" , which we might use in class assignments. Morgan Kaufmann, Second Edition, 1994. The final should be in exam period 16 (Thurs., Dec 19 9:00-11:30am), but this again is tentative and needs to be confirmed. The final exam will focus on material not tested in the mid-term, but the material covered in the earlier part of the course may form background for some of the questions.",
