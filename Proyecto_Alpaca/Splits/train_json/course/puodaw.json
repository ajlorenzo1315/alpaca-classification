Building on introductory classes which showed how a basic computer functions, this course examines techniques for improving computer performance and usability. Topics covered include virtual memory, pipelining, caches (memory hierarchies), and advanced storage systems. We will also discuss a variety of parallel computer systems and future directions in computer architecture. It is assumed that you are familiar with the material covered in CPS 104. If you are not familiar with that material, it is your responsibility to become familiar. Textbook Computer Architecture A Quantitative Approach, 2nd Edition, John L. Hennessy & David A. Patterson Morgan Kaufmann, 1996 Topics Fundamentals of Computer Architecture (Chapter 1) Instruction Set Architecture (Chapter 2, Appendix C) Pipelining (Chapter 3) Advanced Pipelining (Chapter 4) Memory Hierarchy (Chapter 5) Storage Systems (Chapter 6) Interconnection Networks (Chapter 7) Multiprocessors (Chapter 8) Grade To Be Based On: 30% homework 30% project 30% exams (two midterms, and exit interview) 10% class participation Important: Quals grade is based only on the two midterms and exit interview Homework (30% of grade): Homework will be assigned throughout the semester (see handouts ). You are expected to complete the homework individually. However, I encourage discussion between students on topics covered in this class. Exams (30% of grade): There will be two midterm exams and a short exit interview in this course (see important dates ) Research Project (30% of grade): Course projects will be completed individually or in groups of two. A list of possible projects will be provided. Group projects are expected to entail more work than individual projects and require 30 minute presentations (15 minutes per student.) Projects are subject to my approval. You should select your project by September 30. Look here for a list of possible research probjets. Look under Resources for available tools and other useful links.
