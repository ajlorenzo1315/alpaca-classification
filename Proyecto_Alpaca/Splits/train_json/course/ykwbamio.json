This is the World Wide Web (\"the Web\" for short) hypermedia document for CSE/EE 576 and contains information about the class. Assignments The first assignment is to read Chapter 1 of the course notes and do exercise 5. In EE, the machine \"george\" has KHOROS and CANTATA installed on it. Also go to our course home page on the WWW http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/576/index.html and follow the links to the KHOROS/CANTATA tutorial. There is nothing to turn in for this part of the assignment. In each environment: (a) select a monochrome test image. (c) apply a moving average filter to the test image. (g) describe the results obtained in terms of changes in appearance to objects and contours in the test image. Outlines for selected class periods are available here: Friday, 28 April . Monday, 1 May . Monday, 8 May . Monday, 15 May . Monday, 22 May . Students in 576 are permitted to get a temporary copy of MATLAB for their own use in the course. Here are some corrections to the course notes. No class on Friday, March 31 or Monday, April 3. Most students already have a computer account that can access KHOROS and CANTATA. If you do not, contact Renee Reed on Thursday or Friday to make an arrangement to pick up your account login name and password so that you can use it over the weekend and early next week. We will have to take care of that next week.",
