    "Título": "CS 182 Syllabus",
    "Cuerpo": "A background of several upper­ division courses, particularly Algorithms, would be helpful but is not absolutely necessary. In Mathematics, students should have taken at least one course which contains formal definitions, theorems, and proofs. Linear Algebra is usually such a course. There will be some basic number theory that will be covered along the way, so students should be comfortable reading, understanding, and discussing mathematical topics. Materials: There is no textbook to purchase. Topics: The seminar is about systems for encryption and authentication, with an emphasis on mathematical foundations and algorithms. Although implementations, social issues, and legal questions are important, they are of secondary interest. The specific topics will depend on the interests of the participants and the available resources. We will discuss possible topics by the third or fourth week of the semester. Each student will make two to four presentations, one of which will be a report on the student's project. Grades will be determined by the project, seminar presentations, participation in discussion, and contributions to the bibliography.
