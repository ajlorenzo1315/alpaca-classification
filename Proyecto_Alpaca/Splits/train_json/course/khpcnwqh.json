[Harbison and Steele, 1995] Samuel P. Harbison and Guy L. Steele Jr. C: A reference manual. The UNIX Programming Environment . In addition, there will be quizzes from time to time. Quizzes will be announced beforehand. The midterm will be on Wednesday Nov 6 in class. Sample questions from last year's midterm. Programming Assignments There will be weekly programming assignments, which  will be due on Mondays at 11:59pm. You are expected to submit your work (electronically) before this time. Late work will lose credit on the following scale: 15% for work submitted before Noon on Tuesday, 25% for work submitted before 11:59pm on Tuesday, 50% for work submitted before 11:59pm on Wednesday. If you have specific extenuating circumstances requiring you to hand something in late, you should consult Professor Singh before the due date. However, when the time comes to write the code that solves the problem, such discussions are no longer appropriate - the program must be your own work (although you may ask teaching assistants for help in debugging). If you have a question about how to use some feature of C, UNIX, etc., then you can certainly ask your friends or the teaching assistants. Writing code for use by another or using another's code in any form violates the University's academic regulations. Sample Solution Assignment 3: Using an ADT: Word Frequencies Write freq [ options ... ] [ files ... ] , a program that prints, on the standard output, a list of the characters, words and lines that appear in its file arguments and the number of times each appears. Sample Solution Assignment 4: Implementing the list ADT Given the interface of the list ADT in a list.h , write the corresponding implementation in a list.c file. Sample Solution Assignment 5: Implementing \"tail\" in SPARC Assembly Language Write a program, in SPARC assembly language, to print the ``tail'' of the standard input, that is, the last 22 lines of the file. Assignment 6: Implementing \"printf\" in SPARC Assembly Language Due: submitted by 11:59pm, Monday, 11/25. Assignment 8: To be announced.",
