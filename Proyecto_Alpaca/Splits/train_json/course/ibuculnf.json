STL Sample source code is available as a tar file or you can get the files individually . Copies of handouts for section 1 (Mehta), lectures 10, 11, 12, and 13, are available in the Computer Science office, Amos Eaton, Room 127. The deadline for Homework One has been changed to September 25. Students learn the basic Data Structures and Algorithms that are used in applications throughout Computer Science. Using the Data Structures as a base, students then investigate some of the fundamental Algorithms of Computer Science. In addition to course lectures and exams, students will also be responsible for four significant programming projects. If you don't have an RCS account you need to contact us or the TAs to get one! This is a recommended way to ask a question of your fellow class mates... or to ask us or the TAs a question that you think everyone would be interested in hearing about... or to post information that you think would be useful to the class. Email If you have a personal or private question or concern, then just send the instructors or the TAs e-mail, don't post it to the Newsgroup.

You are encouraged to work with other students in the class on the assignments. Code that can be reused includes that found in the textbooks, code from previous work you have done (in this class or others), and code from other books or Internet sites. You may NOT reuse code written by another student in the class. DO NOT \"paraphrase\" code from another source and fail to attribute it in a comment. Any code submitted which the TAs find too similar to another students code, or any code which is similar to code from a book or another source which has not been properly attributed, will result in a zero for the assignment in question and possibly a failing course grade. Policy on Late Work Homeworks are due at 11:59:59 PM, on the due date. If there are circumstances that prevent you from meeting your obligations for this course, you need to talk to us or the TAs to make arrangements IN ADVANCE. If things can't work out, the drop date is September 30, 1996 Bob Dugan dugan@rpi.edu Alok Mehta mehtaa@cs.rpi.edu",
