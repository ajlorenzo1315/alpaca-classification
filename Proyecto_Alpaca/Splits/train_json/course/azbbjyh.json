    "Cuerpo": "Teaching the fundamentals of software project management and working in a team. Providing experience with a real industrial software engineering project. This course will study the concepts, methods, and tools for the specification, design, construction, testing (analysis), and documentation of large software systems. These latter topics are what most industrial feedback says are the most important to employers and are the most often lacking in our graduates. This experimental version of CSE 403, lasting two quarters, will use a real Boeing project as an example, and the participants will work in one large group. There are several reasons for trying this new approach. The first is that one quarter is too short for a realistic project so students cannot learn enough about software engineering due to class sessions being devoted to discussing and organizing the project. In the regular 403 class, the group projects are also usually learning experiences about how hard it is to work in a group, but not enough is learned about how to work effectively together. In addition, students will get experience in requirements analysis and a real software development that is not possible in the normal class setting. At the end of the two quarters, students will have a ``portfolio'' of a real software engineering project that they can use in their job search. An example of such a portfolio, done for the CMU Software Engineering Institute's Masters of Software Engineering program, will be provided at the first class meeting. Requirements analysis Specification Software design Verification and validation (testing and analysis) Configuration management Reviews Maintenance, evolution Reuse Ethics and professionalism in software engineering Embedded systems and safety Roles for Class Project Each student will take one of these leadership roles for the project. However, everyone will participate in each activity or in reviews of the activity so that they get experience with each aspect of a software development team. Project Administrator/Assistant Program Manager: Responsible for project planning and control. Designer 2: Primary responsibility is organizing the development of the new system design. Primary duties include writing the configuration management plan, setting up a configuration management system for the project, document control, organizing changes to the document, ensuring new design is secure. Duties include design of human interface, evaluation of it with respect to requirements, planning user surveys and interviews with Boeing employees. Quality Assurance Specialist: Responsible for the overall quality of the released product. Programming Manager: Responsible for the mockups and prototypes. Documentation Specialist: Responsible for the appearance and clarity of all documentation and for the creation of user manuals.",
