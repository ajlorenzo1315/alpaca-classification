Course Objectives: The main goal of this course is to introduce you to the different aspects of programming languages, including their features, type systems, programming style, and implementation. However, you will gain the necessary skills to understand the impact of language features on both the implementation and the abstractions they provide. We will cover different programming paradigms. As part of the assignments you will be required to program in C++, ML and Prolog. Syntax: what are the legal expressions. 2-3.3 Tuesday 10/8, Syntactic structure Imperative programming Thursday 10/10, Control abstraction, Data abstraction, Ch. 3, 4 Tuesday 10/15, Types Thursday 10/17, Parameter Passing Techniques, Ch. 5 Tuesday 10/22, Storage Management Thursday 10/24, Scope rules Object-oriented programming Tuesday 10/29, Abstraction, Ch. 6 Thursday 10/31, Encapsulation, Ch. 7 - except 7.7 Tuesday 11/5, Information hiding Thursday 11/7, Java Functional programming Tuesday 11/12, Features of Functional languages, Ch. 8 Thursday 11/14, Typed language: ML , Ch. 9 - Packet 1.
