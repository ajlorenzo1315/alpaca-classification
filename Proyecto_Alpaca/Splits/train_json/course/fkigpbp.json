    "Cuerpo": "To a lesser degree, this course will also cover programming paradigms, implementation concerns, and formal specification of programming language semantics. While this course is similar in content, we will be developing interpreters in Scheme . Also here is a draft chapter on types and type inference. The Seasoned Schemer by Friedman and Felleisen, MIT Press, ISBN 0-262-56100-X. Interpreters, The Seasoned Schemer chapter 20, EOPL chapter 5. Week of Feb 19 Representation Independence and Dynamic Scope. Week of Feb 26 Continuation Passing Style. EOPL chapter 8, The Seasoned Schemer chapters 13, 14, 19. Week of March 4 Continuation-Passing Interpreters. Week of March 18 Ski week, no lectures. Week of April 8 Type systems. (last possible due date for take home is May 18) Lecture Notes Lecture notes for each class will be typeset and appear online one or two days after each class. Solutions will be discussed in class after assignments are collected, hence late assignments will not be accepted. Here are some useful Scheme links: R4RS Scheme definition . Scheme Home Page at MIT . We are using MIT Scheme for this course. Even if you are familiar with emacs, you may want to do the first assignment this way. For the interpreters we'll be building in this course, you need to install a few extensions to Scheme. Midterm Exam, the week of March 11. Acknowledgments This course combines ideas and structure from: Essentials of Programming Languages C311 at Indiana University as taught by Dan Friedman CS 311 at Rice University as taught by Matthias Felleisen Andrew Wright / NEC Research Institute / wright@research.nj.nec.com",
