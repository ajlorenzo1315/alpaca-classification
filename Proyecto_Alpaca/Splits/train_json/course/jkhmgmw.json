Lab sections The class is divided into three lab sections which meet in the CS PC Lab , S 332 (the Crawford Science Building). Labs meet at 13:30 to 15:20 on Tuesday, and 10:00 to 11:50 and 15:00 to 16:50 on Wednesday. Programming and Problem Solving with Ada. If time permits, we may cover some additional material. The book comes with a diskette containing all the Ada programs appearing in the book; the programs are also available on the WWW (see below). Information on the net Ada95: Simplified Syntax defines a basic portion of the language corresponding roughly to the portion of Ada covered in cse1001. Ada Core Technologies developers of the GNU Ada Translator (GNAT); How to use the GNAT [local copy; 73K bytes] ada-mode for Emacs aimap Perl script for case of identifers How to run GNAT on Tuck Ada Information Clearinghouse Home Page The special interest group on Ada has a WWW page World Wide Web Home Page for ACM SIGAda that contains information about SIGAda and pointers to other source of information about Ada including Ada Related Jobs Information about Augusta Ada Bryan The programs appearing in Programming and Problem Solving with Ada by Dale, Weems, and McCormick. How to get an Ada Compiler You do not need to get an Ada compiler; will be using the GNAT compiler and it is available both in the CS PC lab (S 332), and by anyone with an account on tuck.cs.fit.edu . If you would like your own Ada compiler, and you have a (large and fast) computer, the GNAT compiler is free. Down-load the distribution from the Ada Core Technologies WWW Page . Programming Style A lengthy and detailed document available on the WWW http://www.cs.fit.edu/~ryan/ada83-style.txt gives specific and sensible advice about writing clear Ada programs. A shorter extract from this document will be handed out in lab. A lengthy and detailed guide for the development of well-constructed programs in general can be found in the following book. You are encouraged to read the textbook in preparation for class and to work the exercises at the end of the chapters. Lab projects will count 45% of the total grade. Each exam and lab project will be assigned a numeric score. Your grade is determined by how you do relatively to the rest of the class, not by the magnitude of your numeric scores. All work is to be your own.

W. Dijkstra We now know that a programmable computer is no more and no less than an extremely handy device for realizing any conceivable mechanism without changing a single wire, and that the core challenge for computing science is hence a conceptual one, viz.",
