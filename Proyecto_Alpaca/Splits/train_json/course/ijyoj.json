    "Cuerpo": "Many of the readings for the course will be online, but the first set of readings is part of my recent book on Lisp and artificial intelligence. Chapter 2 (Introduction to Programming in Common Lisp) and the Lisp glossary may be purchased separately at the Copy Center in the basement of the Communications Building. Common Lisp: The Language, 2nd edition is the standard reference on Common Lisp. Here are some interesting links to info about how to use Lisp for programming World-Wide Web applications. This course is about programming languages and their implementation. Facilities: This quarter, CSE 413 students will have the use of both the MSCC Macintoshes (running Macintosh Common Lisp 3.0) and the MSCC Unix systems. The MSCC Macs are located in the basement of Thompson Hall. While we are fortunate to have the powerful MCL system for this course, there is one disadvantage of using it---you must use it in the MSCC lab unless you purchase your own copy of it from Digitool, Inc. . It has been pointed out that there is a free version of Allegro Common Lisp for Windows which can be downloaded from franz.com on the Web. NOTE THIS: On Thursday, January 4, we will meet in Thompson Hall Room 3, so that we can get introduced to the laboratory facilities for the course. Click here for info on emailing files from the Macs. The midterm examination will be from 10:30-11:50 AM on Thursday, February 8. February 5 Note modifications to the Assignment 5 page -- new deadlines (as announced earlier via email), plus online reading material for part B. February 6 A free postscript viewer for windows is available here . It will be from 4:00-5:00 on Friday, March 8 in Sieg 422. Assignment 1 due on Tuesday, January 9. Assignment 2 due on Tuesday, January 16. Assignment 3 due on Tuesday, January 23. Assignment 4 due on Tuesday, January 30. Project Demonstrations are scheduled for Thursday, March 7 at 10:30. You may turn them in at the review session for the final exam.",
