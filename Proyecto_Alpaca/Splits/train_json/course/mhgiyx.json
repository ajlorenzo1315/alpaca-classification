Malony URL: http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/classes/cis629/ Computer architecture is the science and art of selecting and interconnecting hardware components to create a computer that meets functional, performance and cost goals. Announcements Instructor Lecture Required Text Reference Text Readings Lecture Notes Homeworks Examinations Programming Project Grading Approximate Schedule Tutorials Tools Miscellanea Academic Misconduct Class Roster Announcements 10/1: Required text is available in the bookstore. 10/1: Readings packet 1 is available in the bookstore. 10/22: Please read papers 6, 7, and 8 in readings packet 1. Selected Readings -- Multiprocessor Architectures Each part of the course will be accompanied by a set of papers from the computer architecture literature. Homework There will be two homework assignments. Assignments will be due in class on the due date. Programming The topic of the programming assignment is cache simulation. Run the following trace files through the Dinero cache simulator. Included is only the routine that checks for a reference in the cache and accummulates total references and misses. void Reference(long address) { int index = (address & (CACHE_SIZE-1)) >> BLOCK_SHIFT; long tag = address >> BLOCK_SHIFT; That is, find or write three programs (they can be simple) from which you can capture address references to drive your simulators. This assignment will be due on Dec. 3. The paper should: summarize work in an area, giving extensive references (6 at least) present opinions of others for or against various options (again, with references) conclude with your opinion of the strengths and weaknesses of the arguments given You will be graded on the completeness of your survey, the accuracy of your summaries, and the support you give for your opinions. There are many references for papers including: Proc. of the Conf. on Computer Systems IEEE Computer Grading 20% Homework 30% Midterm 20% Programming 30% Term Project Approximate Schedule Date Topic Assignment Oct. 1 Introduction Chapter 1 Oct. 3 Performance costs Chapter 1; Readings Oct. 8 Pipelining Chapter 3; Readings Oct. 10 Pipelining (continued) Chapter 3; Readings Oct. 15 Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP)* Chapter 3; Readings; Tutorial Oct. 22 ILP: Overcoming Data Hazards Chapter 3; Readings; Tutorial Oct. 24 ILP: Reducing Branch Penalties Chapter 3; Readings; Tutorial Oct. 29 ILP: Superscalar Tutorial Oct. 31 ILP: Limits TAKEHOME MIDTERM Nov. 5 Cache Systems Chapter 2 Nov. 7 Cache Systems Chapter 2; Readings Nov. 12 Memory Systems Chapter 6, Section 6.4 and 6.5; Readings Nov. 14 Multiprocessor Systems Chapter 6, Chapter 7; Readings Nov. 19 No Class Work on Project Nov. 21** Cache Coherent Memory Systems Chapter 6: Readings Nov. 25*** The Sequent STiNG architecture Readings: Sequent STiNG paper Nov. 26 Multiprocessor Architectures Trip to Sequent Nov. 28 THANKSGIVING THANKSGIVING Dec. 3 Multiprocessor Architectures Chapter 6: Readings Dec. 5 Multiprocessor Architectures Chapter 6: Readings Dec. 9 PROJECT DUE PROJECT DUE *   This class will be taught by John Conery. Dinero is a C-based cache simulation program that is provided as part of WARTS. MINT will be available for project use. The WWW Computer Architecture Page was designed at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, to act as a central repository of links pointing to information relevant to computer architecture researchers and students.",
