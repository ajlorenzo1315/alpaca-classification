Related Work The SEQ project is complementary to DEVise in that it is designed to query record based sequenced data. The output of the queries may be visualized with DEVise. Release Information We are currently releasing version 1.1.8 of DEVise. The executables for the Solaris platforms are dynamically linked so you need to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable appropriately to run DEVise. On all other supported architectures, the executables are statically linked and require no shareable libraries at run time. To download DEVise click here.
