    "Cuerpo": "This is the WWW server at the CSRL Lab in the Computer Science Department of the University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA. Isaac The goal of the Isaac project is is to unify methodologies based on existing technology and develop a system for simulating virtual microcosms populated with autonomous robots. My work is centered on building the dynamics simulation engine for Isaac and unifying all the components into one usable system. The \"interactive time\" constraints of the Isaac project necessitate highly efficient model representations, fast linear algebra methods, fast stable DAE solvers, and distribution of the simulation across processes and machines. You can find some papers I've written about Isaac here , and here is a funny \"advertisement\" related to what I do. When I'm not in the lab, I can still do my research at home. \"At home?\" NO! I use Linux, the Unix operating system for personal computers! Click here to go to Linux Links , where you will find links to just about anything you want to know about Linux, including the location of sites you can download it from. I see the primary purpose of this for it's digital signature verification, which allows one to easily refute or detect forged messages. You can do PGP public key lookups here . To get my public key, either use that web interface or \"finger phenning@cs.uiowa.edu\". Hobbies Well, here are some of the things I do when not chained to a computer. Check-out the home page for the smallest brewer in the world, one who makes it just the way I like it, me! NPSNet Research Group : Good VE stuff. GVU Meta Virtual Environments : VE Web Index.
