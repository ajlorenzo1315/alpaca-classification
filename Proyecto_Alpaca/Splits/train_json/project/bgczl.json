Lokanathan Stan Yoder Introduction and Goals: The purpose of this three-year reseach project (1994-1996) is to develop a framework and systematic methodology to facilitate the application of Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) to a diverse class of system design problems. MDO is based upon the philosophy of identifying the appropriate combination of parameters which are under the control of a designer (or design team) and which will result in the most effective product or system. The development, archiving and exchange of information between these individual experts is central to the design task. It is this information which provides the basis for these experts to make their design decisions - resulting in the final product. A variety of methods and applications are being considered. In each case the fundamental approach is to provide the individual discipline expert with the information necessary to evaluate the system as a whole and to be able to understand the impact of individual decisions on the overall system design. The current research effort is a joint program between the Departments of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering and the Computer Science and Engineering Departments at the University of Notre Dame. These problems are being selected so that they represent a diverse spectrum of MDO applications and will present a variety of challenges for the methods being developed and evaluated as part of this research program. As this three year program continues, information related to each of the primary phases of the project will be added to this document. The results of those issues identified as Future Efforts will be used to assess applicability of the MDO tools to a wide variety of applications.
