    "Cuerpo": "PSP stands for Programs, Specifications and Proofs. The emphasis of the work of our group is to derive parallel and distributed programs in a rigorous manner. The group is supervised by Jayadev Misra , who developed the theories we work on. The research areas are: UNITY , Powerlists and Seuss . UNITY UNITY is a programming notation and a logic to reason about parallel and distributed programs. Unity is presented in the book: J. Misra and K. M. Chandy, Parallel Program Design: A Foundation , Addison-Wesley, 1988. The notes on UNITY is a series of papers presenting various results about UNITY and its applications. The notes assumes a basic understanding of the UNITY theory as presented in Chandy and Misra's book. Since the publication of the book several improvements have been made in the theory, some of which are reflected in the notes on UNITY , Jayadev Misra has written a manuscript for a book that presents the New UNITY , this includes the introduction of a new temporal operator co for specifying safety. Powerlists Powerlists is a notation for synchronous parallel programs and circuits. Many parallel algorithms have a succinct presentation  and simple proofs in the powerlist notation. Jayadev Misra's paper Powerlists: A Structure for Parallel Recursion presents the notation and gives numerous examples of algorithms and proofs of their correctness, including the Fast Fourier Transform and Batcher's sorting network. Will Adams has studied how different arithmetic circuits, such as adders and multipliers, can be specified and proved correct in the powerlist notation. His paper Verifying adder circuits using powerlists is available. Jacob Kornerup has studied how powerlist programs can be mapped efficiently to different parallel architectures, specially hypercubes. See his List of papers for details. Seuss Seuss is an offspring of the work on UNITY. For an introduction to Seuss, read the Overview of Seuss . A compiler for Seuss that genrates C++ code and PVM calls for message communicating networks is described in the thesis An experiment in compiler design for a concurrent object-based programming language of Ingolf Krüger .
