The current research interests of faculty in the group include algorithm design, complexity theory, parallel computation, graph theory, and probabilistic methods. Vijaya Ramachandran (vlr@cs.utexas.edu) --- Parallel computation; algorithm design and analysis; machine models; graph theory and graph algorithms. Affiliated Folks (Postdocs, students, alumni, etc.) Sanjoy Baruah (sanjoy@emba.uvm.edu) Tsan-sheng Hsu (tshsu@iis.sinica.edu.tw) Pierre Kelsen (kelsen@mpi-sb.mpg.de) Madhukar Korupolu (madhukar@cs.utexas.edu) Phil MacKenzie (philmac@cs.idbsu.edu) Ramgopal Mettu (ramgopal@cs.utexas.edu) C.

This is a low volume mailing list with typically no more than a dozen messages a semester. You can add yourself to this mailing list by sending an e-mail message to vlr@cs.utexas.edu expressing your interest in being added to the algorithms mailing list. WARM WARM stands for the Workshop on Algorithms Research in the Midsouth (or Midsouthwest). This is a forum for researchers in theoretical computer science in Texas and surrounding states that meets once or twice a year at different locations. Often there is a distinguished keynote speaker. The first WARM was organized by Vijaya Ramachandran at UT Austin in the Spring of 1990. Greg Plaxton organized another WARM at UT Austin in Fall 1994. The next WARM is scheduled to be held at UT Dallas on November 9, 1996. Program announcements about WARM are sent out on the algorithms mailing list when they become available. Announcements regarding these arrangements are also sent out on the algorithms mailing list. ACM SIGACT SIGACT stands for the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computational Theory. This is a very active group that includes many distinguished computer scientists. SIGACT sponsors the ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC) and is a co-sponsor of the ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA) and the ACM Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures (SPAA).
