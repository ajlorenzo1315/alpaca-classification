The very performance metric(s) of interest in a high-speed network will also be different -- average delay will no longer be the primary performance measure, and, instead, secondary performance measures such as probability of buffer overflow, maximum packet delay, and the tail of delay distributions must be considered. We also note that many previous performance evaluation techniques have been confined to studying the performance of the aggregate traffic generated by a set of identical sources at a single multiplexer in isolation; in connection-oriented high-speed networks with QOS guarantees, it is clear that performance must be examined on a per-session basis and in a network setting [Kuro92,Schu92]. Given the above considerations, it is evident that new performance evaluation techniques will be required for the design and analysis future high-speed networks. Our research is unique in that we are interested in computing provable performance bounds , and in doing so on a per-session basis in a very general network setting in which sessions may traverse a number of hops. In these cases, it will be of interest to compute performance, albeit in an approximate manner, once again -- in a network setting. We are also developing routing policies for high-speed networks [Hwan91,Hwan92]. Our research in [Hwan92,Hwan92a] is aimed at exploiting the similarities with routing in traditional circuit-switched networks and adapting these policies for the case of high-speed ATM networks.
