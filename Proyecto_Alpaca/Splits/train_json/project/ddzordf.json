Active Messages for the IBM SP-2 An object-code release of SP2 AM for AIX 3.2 is available in gam-1.0.aix3.tar.Z . Please read README and INSTALL files in the distribution for instructions on using SP2 AM. For more information contact: Chi-Chao Chang , Grzegorz Czajkowski , Thorsten von Eicken . Please read the ReleaseNotes.aix3 file to find out about the changes from the previous version. The current version of SP2 AM is 1.0f. This paper investigates the use of Active Messages (AM) communication primitives as an alternative to the standard message passing in order to reduce communication overheads and to offer a good building block for higher layers of software. The first part of this paper describes an implementation of Active Messages (SP AM) which is layered directly on top of the SP's network adapter (TB2). With comparable bandwidth, SP AM's low overhead yields a round-trip latency that is 40% lower than IBM MPL's. Split-C benchmarks are used to compare the SP to other MPPs and show that low message overhead and high throughput compensate for SP's high network latency. Abstract: This technical report describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of Active Messages on the IBM SP-2. The Generic Active Message Specification, Version 1.1 defines an Active Messages interface which is portable across a variety of parallel machines. This paper examines whether these techniques can carry over to clusters of workstations connected by an ATM network even though clusters use standard operating system software, are equipped with network interfaces optimized for stream communication, do not allow direct protected user-level access to the network, and use networks without reliable transmission or flow control. In a first part, this paper describes the differences in communication characteristics between clusters of workstations built from standard hardware and software components and state-of-the-art multiprocessors. A second part evaluates a prototype implementation of the low-latency Active Messages communication model on a Sun workstation cluster interconnected by an ATM network.

We further show that active messages are sufficient to implement the dynamically scheduled languages for which message driven machines were designed.
