    "Cuerpo": "Brief History and Method Outline Mathematical optimization approaches, in particular linear programming, have long been used in problems of pattern separation. In [65] linear programs were used to construct planes to separate linearly separable point sets. MSM separates 2 disjoint finite point sets in n -dimensional Euclidean space as follows: Choose 2 parallel planes in n -dimensional Euclidean space as close together so that only the region between the two planes contains points from both sets (i.e. the regions NOT between the 2 parallel planes contain only points of 1 set or no points). Repeat the process on the points between the 2 parallel planes, until the region between the 2 parallel planes contains no points or very few points. The goal of MSM-T is to determine a sequence of planes in n -dimensional Euclidean space that separate the  sets A and B as follows: Determine a plane in n -dimensional Euclidean space that minimizes the average \"distances\" of misclassified points. A point from set A is misclassified if it lies on the side of the separating plane assigned to B . Similarly, a point from set B is misclassified if it lies on the side of the separating plane assigned to A . If the regions assigned to A and B contain only (or mostly) points of the set A or B , then stop. Otherwise, generate another error-minimizing plane (in 1.) The sequence of planes generated can be viewed as a decision tree. This linear programming approach can also be viewed as training a neural network with 1 hidden layer (see [93] ). Implementations of MSM-T MSM-T has been implemented in C using the MINOS numerical optimization package by Nick Street and Kristin Bennett . MSM-T has also been implemented for the MATLAB optimization package by Paul Bradley .
