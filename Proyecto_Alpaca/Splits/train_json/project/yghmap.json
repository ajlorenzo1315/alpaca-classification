Most of the research done here concerns the development of volume rendering techniques for use in scientific visualization. Currently, we have projects in: architectures for volume rendering, parallel methods for volume rendering (regular and irregular grids), development of tools for visualization, flow visualization, ... We also do research in several other areas of computer graphics, such as virtual reality and geometric techniques. The laboratory was founded and is headed by Leading Professor Arie E. Kaufman. Our laboratory has a comprehensive visualization tool, the VolVis system. The system is available free of charge in both binary and source format and it runs on virtually any machine that supports X/UNIX/MOTIF.",
