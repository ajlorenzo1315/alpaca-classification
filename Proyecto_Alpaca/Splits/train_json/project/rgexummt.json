    "Cuerpo": "One of the biggest performance challenge today is the speed mismatch between the microprocessors and memory. To address this challenge, we predict that over the next decade processors and memory will be merged onto a single chip. Not only will this narrow or altogether remove the processor-memory performance gap, it will have the following additional benefits: provide an ideal building-block for parallel processing, amortize the costs of fabrication lines, and better utilize the phenomenal number of transistors that can be placed on a single chip. Let's dub it an \"IRAM\", standing for Intelligent RAM, since most of transistors on this merged chip will be devoted to memory. All input/output devices will be linked to them via networks, as will be other IRAMs. If they need more memory, they get more processing power as well, and vice versa -- an arrangement that will keep the memory capacity and processor speed in balance. A single gigabit IRAM should have an internal memory bandwidth of nearly 1000 gigabits per second (32K bits in 50 ns), a hundredfold increase over the fastest computers today. Off-chip accesses will go over 1 gigabit per second serial links. Hence the fastest programs will keep most memory accesses within a single IRAM, rewarding compact representations of code and data. This advanced graduate course, led by Prof. David Patterson , re-examined the design of hardware and software that is based on the traditional separation of the memory and the processor. Related Work IRAM's large improvement in memory system bandwidth has significant potential for helpng configurable systems to achieve their full performance potential. Configurable systems offer improved performance by adapting processing capabilities to application-specific needs. But by making the processing portion of an application go faster, a conventional memory system will be more and more of a drag on performance. Memory bandwidth is also the performance bottleneck to rapid reprogramming of the configurable elements.
