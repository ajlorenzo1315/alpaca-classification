About the CSRVL The Cornell Computer Science Robotics and Vision Laboratory is located at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. We have three main areas of research: Computer vision ( Prof. Daniel Huttenlocher ) Multimedia applications of computer vision ( Prof. Ramin Zabih ) Robotics , including distributed manipulation and micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS) ( Prof. Bruce Donald ) Here is a pictoral tour of the CSRVL. Automatic Detection and Classification of Scene Breaks in Digital Video . These include parallel implementations in Split-C for U-Net and symmetric multiprocessors . We have a list of potential Master's projects, maintained by Justin Miller . There is a discussion of some of the issues here . We are hopeful that this move will be supported by Microsoft . Selected Publications The following is a list of selected papers of research done at the CSRVL. Many publications from the Cornell Robotics and Vision Laboratory are available from the Cornell CS Tech-Reports server. ( See below. ) Only those papers not available from the CS-TR server are listed here. On the Complexity of Computing the Homology Type of a Triangulation (B. Donald and D. Chang), Revised MS based on the paper IEEE Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science San Juan, (October 1991), pp. ed. R. Wilson and J.-C.Latombe (1994). Sensorless Manipulation Using Massively Parallel Microfabricated Actuator Arrays , K.-F. Böhringer, B. R. Donald, R. Mihailovich, and N. C. MacDonald, Proc. A Theory of Manipulation and Control for Microfabricated Actuator Arrays , K.-F. Böhringer, B. R. Donald, R. Mihailovich, and N. C. MacDonald, Proceedings of the IEEE Workshop on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems , Oiso, Japan (January, 1994). Technical Reports by Author These lists are generated dynamically by the Cornell CS-TR Server.",
