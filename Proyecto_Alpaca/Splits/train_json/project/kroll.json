Objectives The objectives of the PLinda project are two-fold: Fault tolerant parallel computing - provide language constructs that facilitate the design of high performance fault-tolerant parallel programs. Harness the aggregate power of idle cycles on networks of workstations in a manner that is fault-tolerant and does not disturb the owners of the workstations at all. Applications The major class of PLinda applications are long-running coarse grain parallel applications. Example applications: NILE project Data mining (eg. biological pattern discovery) Distribution Source code is available! And here is how to install it. Please refer to the PLinda User Manual for additional information. FAQ Future Work Debuggers and run-time visualization tools. Programming tools for data mining. A distributed run-time kernel for PLinda.
