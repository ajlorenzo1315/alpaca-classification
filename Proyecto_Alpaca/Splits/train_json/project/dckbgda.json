We propose to develop a new software abstraction, called the collaboration bus, that makes it easy to compose collaborative systems. The collaboration bus will be an extensible infrastructure that provides general definitions of collaboration services, default implementations of these services, rules for interconnecting these services, and mechanisms for extending the set of supported services. The set of generic services supported by the bus will include (a) a data model for defining shared workspaces consisting of structured objects; (b) a user interface model that allows shared objects to be manipulated using user interfaces that support text, graphics, audio, video, and virtual reality; (c) a coupling model that enables users in a joint session to share data and user-interface objects and controls their interactions to ensure security and consistency contraints are not violated; (d) migration and replication mechanisms that ensure that the bus does not become a bottleneck; and (e) real-time services, consisting of scheduling algorithms and network protocols, for ensuring real-time coupling among the collaborators. It will offer two forms of interoperability: (1) inter-service interoperability, which will allow existing implementations of different collaboration services, such as user-interface and real-time services, to be combined in new collaborative systems; and (2) intra-service interoperability, which will resolve inconsistencies among different, competing instances of the same service, such as explicit and implicit schemes for creating joint sessions, provided by different existing systems that need to interoperate with each other. Click on the picture to see a bigger version. The concept of a collaboration bus requires a general abstraction that covers the functionality of existing collaborative systems. It must also define composition functions that allow a service to be composed with other collaboration services. The following approach will be used in designing, implementing and evaluating the bus: (a) Identify the services that a collaborative application requires. (b) Identify a reference model for each of these services. (c) Identify semantics translations and composition functions for each of these services. (d) Incorporate, into the bus, a default implementation of the service and the associated semantic translations and composition functions. (e) Develop mechanisms and policies for replicating and migrating parts of the bus. (f) Develop mechanisms for protecting the operations on the bus. (c) Design version 1 of the collaboration bus, which will include reference models, semantic translations, and composition functions for session management, coupling, and virtual environments. (d) Start a Java-based implementation of version 1 of the bus. Other Project Information IC & V Meeting Talk Postscript -- one slide per page, works with gv.
