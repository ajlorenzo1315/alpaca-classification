It supports performance measurement, modeling, tuning, and visualization. Carnival measurements are based on predicate profiling , which quantifies the time spent in each category of overhead during execution. In particular, Carnival currently supports waiting time analysis , an automatic inference process that explains each source of waiting time in terms of the underlying causes, instead of simply identifying where it occurs. We are now developing a similar technique to explain the causes of communication. Towards that end, Carnival supports lost cycles analysis , which uses a priori knowledge of the sources and characteristics of the overhead categories in parallel systems to guide and constrain the modeling process. Carnival is also a visualization tool that provides a link between performance measurements and the source code. Along the left hand side of the source is a grey-scale scroll bar that indicates the amount of time spent in each portion of the source code (summed across all processors).
