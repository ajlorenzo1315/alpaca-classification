    "Cuerpo": "To alleviate this problem, modern processors issue multiple instructions per cycle (i.e., superscalars), or interleave the execution of different threads in different cycles (multithreaded processors). Ultimately, though, both techniques are limited by the amount of parallelism available within a single thread in a single cycle. Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) is a technique that permits multiple independent threads to issue instructions to a superscalar's functional units in a single cycle. SMT combines the multiple-instruction-issue features of wide superscalar processors with the latency-hiding ability of multithreaded architectures. We have shown that these performance gains can be achieved in an architecture with only minimal extensions to modern out-of-order superscalar processors.
