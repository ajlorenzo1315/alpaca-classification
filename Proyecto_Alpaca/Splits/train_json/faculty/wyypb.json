A major focus is improving the dialog between human teachers and machine learners. Toward the goal of widening the ``communication pipeline'' between human and machine, we have been developing a language for providing, in a natural manner and at any time, general-purpose advice to a machine learner. Based on techniques developed in our work on knowledge-based neural networks, these instructions are inserted directly into learner. Currently, we are extending the language used to advise our learning algorithms, studying new ways of incorporating this advice into neural networks, investigating the extraction of human-comprehensible rules from trained neural networks, and developing methods for choosing good representations for training examples. We are also developing parallel algorithms, on the department's Condor system and our CM-5 computer, for machine learning and computational biology. Shavlik (1992) and (1996) provide an overview of our approach to knowledge-based neural networks.
