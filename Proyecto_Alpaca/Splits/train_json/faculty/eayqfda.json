    "Cuerpo": "He received his Ph.D in Computer Science from the University of Colorado in 1981. His most recent academic work has focused on algorithms for the central combinatorial problems involved in DNA sequencing, and on a wide range of sequence and pattern comparison problems. Among the tools he has developed are Blast -- a widely used tool for protein similarity searches, Anrep -- a pattern matching language for applications in molecular biology, and MacMolecule -- a molecular visualization tool for Apple computers. Dr. Myers is an editor for Computer Application in the Biosciences, the Journal of Computational Biology, and Gene-COMBIS -- an electronic journal.
