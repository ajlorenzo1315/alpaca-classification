( Computer Engineering ) University of Michigan, 1981 Research Interests: Computer architecture Parallel computing Memory systems Performance evaluation Research Summary My research targets the memory systems of shared-memory multiprocessors and high-performance uniprocessors. The Wisconsin Wind Tunnel project is so named because we use our tools to cull the design space of parallel supercomputers in a manner similar to how aeronautical engineers use conventional wind tunnels to design airplanes.
