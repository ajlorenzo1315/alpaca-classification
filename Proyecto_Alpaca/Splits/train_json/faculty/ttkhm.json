Badri with the Best Teacher Award I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Rutgers University . I am also a member and research director of mobile computing at WINLAB here at Rutgers. Research Welcome to the world of Badri's Research . My research interest is primarily in the area of Mobile Wireless Computing. The primary research issues being investigated include: Mobility As hosts move, environment changes. How should the network handle moving hosts? How should the mobile host react to change in environment? How should applications be structured to handle a pipe made of fixed and wireless links. Energy Battery is a consumable resource. How to extend battery life? Specific projects include: Environment awareness and client server adaptation Composing client and server modules for easy adaptation and migration. Hoarding data by issuing queries. Integrating data and concurrency control issues. Local caching issues. As part of our research we have developed multicasting protocol for mobile hosts, designed distributed algorithms for systems with mobile hosts, developed an indirect model for protocols  so that it works better in wireless/wireline networks, developed data organization and data dissemination methods for broadcast data, and currently investigating operating system support for mobile hosts.
