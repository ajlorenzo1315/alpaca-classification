Rosen Bruce E. Rosen Assistant Professor B.S. Computer Science (1986) Ph.D. Computer Science (1991) University of California, Los Angeles Areas of Interest Neural networks, stochastic function optimization, parallel pattern recognition systems, scientific and biomedical computing, time series analysis, numerical and combinatorial optimization problems, and human computer interaction. Summary of Research My research examines using advanced, parallel simulated annealing and genetic algorithms methods in multivariate function approximation and combinatorial optimization tasks. My research also involves using neural network methods for pattern recognition and analysis, including time series analysis. In the Biomedical Computing Laboratory I am working on two research projects: 1) Computer Aided Fetal Heart Rate Analysis and 2) Computer Aided Dermatological anaylsis of Pigmented Skin Lesions. Both projects involve using artificial neural networks for biomedical pattern recognition.
