My work is a blend of human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence. My dissertation dealt with a system called Aide, an assistant for intelligent data exploration. Data exploration is difficult: though a statistical package may take over the burden of computation, still the user must sift through an enormous number of potential patterns and relationships, deciding which procedures are appropriate, and relying on cues in the data and knowledge of external context to guide the process. I've also become involved with the ACM SIGCHI Educational Resource Development Group, working to identify educational resources geared toward HCI. Artificial intelligence: I served on the program committee for the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-96) and I'm currently on the program committee for the Second International Conference on Intelligent Data Analysis ( IDA-97 ). I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science in 1996 from the University of Massachusetts, where I worked in the Experimental Knowledge Systems Laboratory. My thesis advisor was Paul Cohen , and my committee included Vic Lesser and Arny Rosenberg. Here are a few of my publications: Robert St. Amant and Paul R. Cohen.
