Her Ph.D. advisers were Drs. Allan Gottlieb and Ralph Grishman . These research interests are the main focus of her Parallel Research Group at NMSU. Dr. Teller's research has been funded by Sandia National Laboratories, the U. S. Army Research Office, and Los Alamos National Laboratory. Teller is a reviewer for major conferences and journals and has been on the program committee of several major conferences. Abstract. Trace-driven simulation of shared-memory architectures can be as accurate as execution- or program-driven simulations for a large class of parallel programs. Traces for programs in this class can be scheduled or unscheduled. A scheduled trace is a set of traces generated by running a parallel program on a real or simulated MP, while an unscheduled trace is an augmented trace generated by running a parallel program on a uniprocessor. Scheduled traces can be used to drive simulations of only MP systems with the same number of processors as the MP that generated the trace and are limited to the same static task-to-processor scheduling as the MP that generated the trace. In contrast, unscheduled traces offer much more flexibility. In addition, we show how an unscheduled trace allows the task granularity of a traced program to be varied from simulation to simulation and how operating system references can be inserted dynamically during simulation. CS579 Simulation of Computer Architectures . The course will cover research in the area of simulation of computer architectures, both uniprocessor and multiprocessors architectures. You can examine the syllabus of the course, lecture notes, and papers that are being analyzed by the students, among other things. CS273 Course Materials CS273 is a course in Machine Organization and Assembly Language. Course materials, including transparencies and a MC68HC11 simulator with a graphical user interface will be available at this WWW site during or before December 1995. ; Click here to see a description of the reading that has been assigned in the course.
