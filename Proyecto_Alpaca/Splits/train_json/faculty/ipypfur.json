He has served as an IEEE Computer Society Distinguished Visitor, and has been awarded the University of Utah College of Engineering Outstanding Teaching Award. Dr. Lindstrom is chair of the Organick Memorial Lecture Series . Our OM is based on system server concepts, presenting a standardized interface to C++ and Common Lisp (CL) programs. The MSO approach to persistence emphasizes (i) generality of source language support, (ii) portability and heterogeneity, (iii) data evolution, (iv) distributed implementation and access, and (v) the representation of software components as objects managed through a pervasive system service. Module manipulation tools: The Fast and Flexible Mach-based Systems project seeks to develop an operating system that provides a much higher degree of flexibility than do traditional systems, and to use that added flexibility to circumvent the performance/functionality tradeoffs that thwart traditional highly-decomposed, microkernel-based operating systems. Software for human genetics applications: In collaboration with the Utah Center for Human Genome Research, software is being developed to aid in genetic applications such as linkage analysis, genetic and physical mapping, and large scale genetic sequencing.
