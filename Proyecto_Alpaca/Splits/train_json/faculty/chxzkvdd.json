    "Cuerpo": "Working with graduate student Jim Jennings, research associate Daniela Rus, graduate student Russell Brown , and lab alumnus Jonathan Rees (now at MIT), we developed a team of autonomous mobile robots that can perform sophisticated distributed manipulation tasks (such as moving furniture ). Graduate student Amy Briggs worked with Dan Huttenlocher's vision group to develop a sensor planning and surveillance system for a team of mobile robots. Tommy and Lily are mobile robots we built. Using algorithms developed by the vision group in our lab , Lily can track Tommy and follow him, using visual information alone. Briggs and B. R.
