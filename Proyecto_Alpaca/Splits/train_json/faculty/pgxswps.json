(1983), University of Mysore, India Areas of Interest Computer Architecture, Fault-Tolerance, Networks, and Parallel Processing Summary of Research I am interested in integrating the access of nonlocal data and message routing in multicomputers and distributed shared memory multiprocessors. In my recent work, I have investigated methods to enhance known wormhole routing algorithms to handle faults, deadlock issues in multicast communication, and design of new wormhole routing algorithms. I am applying my results on fault-tolerant and multicast communication to current router designs such as the multichip routers implemented in Cray T3D(TM) to study the design of next generation routers and switch fabrics for high-speed local area networks.
