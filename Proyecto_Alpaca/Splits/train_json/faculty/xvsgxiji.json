    "Cuerpo": "Research Interests Computer Chess (Crafty) This research is developing the computer chess program \"Crafty\", which is a direct descendent of Cray Blitz, the World Computer Champion from 1983 to 1989. This program is a \"freeware\" package available from ftp.cis.uab.edu/pub/hyatt. This program is currently searching around 80,000 nodes per second on a P6/200 processor, and is playing on ICC and chess.net regularly. Its current ICC ratings are 2610 (bullet), 2750 (blitz) and 2533 (standard). The current work is concentrated in three areas: using parallel machines to search deeper into the game tree, inproving the chess knowledge contained in the program so that it plays better positional chess and also so that its strategy is goal-oriented rather than random, and improving the search strategies so that the program analyzes deeper in those positions that require it without wasting time on deep searches for those positions that do not need it. Parallel Architectures and Software This research studies various parallel machine architectures and how they can best be used to improve the speed of software applications. Research into this last group is being supported by Cray Research in order to learn how to use multiple Cray XMP and YMP computer systems to solve a single problem. Algorithm design, debugging, and performance analysis of parallel algorithms are being studied in order to inprove the execution speed of parallel code. This system is continually being revised as it is used in various research projects. MS, University of Southern Mississippi, 1983. Ph.D., University of Alabama at Birmingham, 1988.
