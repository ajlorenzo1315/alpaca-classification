My interests in this topic have ranged over a broad spectrum that encompasses theoretical aspects, such as error bounds for mathematical programs and variational inequalities, convergence proofs for parallel gradient and variable distribution algorithms for optimization, smoothing techniques for solving constrained optimization problems as differentiable nonlinear equations, as well as applications to machine learning, both in general and specific contexts. An important aspect of my research is the use of mathematical programming techniques in diagnosing breast cancer, that has resulted in a highly accurate computerized diagnostic system in current use at University of Wisconsin Hospitals.
