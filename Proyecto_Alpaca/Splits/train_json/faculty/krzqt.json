The ultimate in register allocation is interprocedural register allocation in which all the procedures of a program are analyzed. We have studied interprocedural allocation models that optimally allocate register among procedures in polynomial time. What's more, the approach seems to be effective in practice. Errors involving pointers and array indices are especially common. Recent Publications \"Minimum Cost Interprocedural Register Allocation,\" Steven M. Kurlander and Charles N.
