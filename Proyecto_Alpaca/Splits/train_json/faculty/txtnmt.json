Computational Science and Engineering Professor Stevenson is very active in the development of Computational Science and Engineering at Clemson and on the national scene. For more information on this work see the the Clemson Computational Science and Engineering Resource homepage . While we are talking about geometry, he is trying to lay a constructive foundation on Euclid. The slides for those presentations are available: Computational Science and Engineering: Science in the 90s\" . This is a talk outlining CSE and placing it in the context of the working scientist and engineer. It discusses some of the problems in using the current systems. The full presentation has been submitted Papers A paper documenting an invited presentation at a workshop held at the Mathematics Department, Stockholm University. A paper outlining the foundations of a new programming language called eb has been submitted to POPL . Sorry about that.] The title of this article is \"Science, Computational Science, and Computer Science: At a Crossroads\". A version of CACM paper is to be presented at the Southeastern Region of SIAM A paper relating computational science and software engineering practices. Here are some ideas I've had for projects. Implementation of a programming language to support constructive computational science and engineering. Development of constructive theories of computational science. Implementation of various graphics/visulization programs. Bon Sai Beauty A formal upright Redwood with shari that was done partly by pealing from the top of the tree and the balance with a knife.",
