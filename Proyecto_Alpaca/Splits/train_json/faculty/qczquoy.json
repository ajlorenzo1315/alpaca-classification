However, I later did my Ph.D. research in the theory of protocol design. For recent papers, click here . My goal is to fruitfully combine my experience in distributed systems, both theory and practice. Recent work in distributed algorithms include a result that shows that crash failures can cause almost all asynchronous protocols to fail (assuming that nodes keep no NVRAM across crashes), and techniques for making window protocols self-stabilizing. Past work on network protocols includes techniques for speeding up packet processing based on adding fields to packets, making hop-by-hop flow control both efficient and reliable, efficient fair queuing using deficit round robin, and efficient timer algorithms. For example, I have taught the network protocol class for senior Wash U undergraduates for three semesters, and have taught them some protocol design techniques. I taught the Distributed Algorithms class in the Spring of 95 and taught a tutorial on applying techniques from distributed algorithms in SIGCOMM 95. I will teach a tutorial on efficient protocol implementation techniques in SIGCOMM 96. RECENT PAPERS My recent papers on both networking and self-stabilization can be obtained from the web. EDUCATION PhD in Computer Science -- MIT (2/93) MS in Computer Science -- NCSU (8/83) B.Tech in Electrical Engineering -- I.I.T. Bombay, India (8/81) STUDENTS Girish Chandranmenon . Mahesh Jayaram . Adam Costello . COURSE OUTLINE FOR CS564T In the spring of 1995, I taught a course on concurrent message passing algorithms, with emphasis on applications to network protocols. Thus we illustrate the main ideas using actual protocols from existing networks. I taught an abbreviated version of that course as a tutorial in SIGCOMM 95.
