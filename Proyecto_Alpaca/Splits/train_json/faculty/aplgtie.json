This has led to the development of strategies for human-like, error-tolerant parsing, and of increasingly expressive logics for capturing the content of natural language utterances in all their richness. The most recently developed representation, episodic logic (EL), associates episodes with sentences and allows for adjective/adverb-like predicate modifiers, property/proposition-forming operators, and other language-like constructs, simplifying the process of mapping from language to the meaning representation. The theoretical investigation of natural language processing and knowledge representation has been accompanied by the development of implemented systems intended to support language understanding, reasoning and planning. This has provided both a context for some of the above work on language processing, and an impetus for recent work on ``scalable'' temporal reasoning, and on a new approach to the frame problem in planning, called ``explanation closure.'' ``Accelerating partial order planners by improving plan and goal choices.''
