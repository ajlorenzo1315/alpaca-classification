Hovy Biographical Information Ugly photo . Research Interests Currently heading the Natural Language Processing group at USC/ISI doing research on various aspects of natural language processing, specifically on Machine Translation and automated text planning and generation. Am personally involved in five research directions: the construction of the Pangloss family of machine translation systems (this work originally in conjunction with researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and New Mexico State University); the development of theories of discourse structure and the construction of multisentence text and sentence planning systems (this work in collaboration with researchers at the Universities of Waterloo and Toronto in Canada); the development of sentence generation theory and systems, including management of the Penman project; the development of theory to address problems in multimedia human-computer communication (in collaboration with people at ISI); and the development of MEDTRANS, a system to translate and convey forms and information among Health Care providers (this work in collaboration with the DSSA group at ISI). I am interested in all facets of communication, especially human language, as used to express intelligence. and E.H. Hovy. Byte Magazine Special Feature on Machine Translation (167-176).
