    "Cuerpo": "Current Areas of Interest and Research: Professor Thompson's primary research interest is in the area of computer vision, with an emphasis on problems involving the determination of shape and spatial organization for tasks in robotics. Building on Utah's experience in CAGD (computer aided geometric design) for manufacturing, we are investigating novel sensing strategies specifically suited to man-made objects. We are developing a novel approach to providing test data for image understanding. Rapid Virtual Prototyping of Assemblies. In this effort, we are constructing a haptic interface so that a designer will be able to touch, hold, and move models of parts and assemblies as well as see them in rendered views. The result will be an environment in which part interactions can be considered in a more natural manner than is possible with current technology. This project focuses on the analysis of visual motion, including optical flow estimation in the presence of discontinuities, extracting shape properties in a qualitative manner that avoids much of the complexity and noise sensitivity of tranditional structure-from-motion methods, and detecting moving objects in the environment when the sensor might also be moving. Professor Thompson is currently on the Advisory Board of the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence  and previously served as an Associate Editor of that journal.
