His research concerns computer systems and computer system performance. Recent specific topics have included parallel discrete-event simulation, scheduling policies for multiprocessors, kernel structures to support high-performance parallel computing, programming systems for networks of multiprocessors, effective program performance monitoring tools for parallel systems, the interaction of architecture and operating system design, hardware and software techniques for high performance communication, and, most recently, operating system and programming system support that exploits wide-address architectures (Opal) . (The graduate students seem to have picked up on this ( 1.7Mb Quicktime ).) He also hosts lots of visitors, a surprising number of whom have funny noses . Lazowska is a member of the Board of Directors of the Computing Research Association (CRA's members include essentially all graduate departments and industrial research laboratories in the field), and Chair of CRA's Government Affairs Committee . He serves on the National Science Foundation's Advisory Committee for Computer and Information Science and Engineering , and on the National Research Council's Computer Science and Telecommunications Board . He is a member of the 6-person Technical Advisory Board for Microsoft Research , of the 4-person National Semiconductor Computer Science & Systems Academic Advisory Council , of the Board of Directors of Data I/O Corporation , and of the Scientific Advisory Board for Cable & Howse Ventures' Cascadia Fund. He belongs to the standing advisory committees for the Department of EECS at UC Berkeley and the Departments of Computer Science at Stanford University , the University of Virginia , and the Hong Kong University of Science & Technology , and is a member of ACM's A.M. Turing Award selection committee. He has just completed service on a 12-person National Research Council panel reviewing the multi-agency High Performance Computing and Communications program (the \"Brooks/Sutherland Committee\"), and has recently served as Chair of the Committee of Examiners for the Graduate Record Examinations Board Computer Science Test, Chair of ACM SIGMETRICS (the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group concerned with computer system performance), Chair of the ACM Software Systems Award Committee, Program Chair of the 13th ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, and editor of IEEE Transactions on Computers . At the University of Washington, in addition to serving as Chair of the Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Lazowska is Chair of the University Advisory Committee on Academic Technology. He has recently served as a member of the Committee on the Deanship of the College of Arts and Sciences, as Chair of the review committee for the Ph.D. program in Molecular Biotechnology, and as a member of the performance review committee for the Dean of Engineering. Seventeen Ph.D. students and 21 M.S. students have completed degrees working with him.
