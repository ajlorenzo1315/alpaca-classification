    "Cuerpo": "Before that, I spent five years at AT&T Bell Laboratories. This semester, I am teaching a course called Engineering Computer Networks . I am teaching from a textbook I just completed, which will be published by Addison-Wesley this December. Most of my research is in flow and congestion control , mostly for connectionless networks (such as the Internet). The one line summary of my thinking is: The one true religion is round-robin scheduling and packet-pair flow control . Let me explain what that means. Thus, round robin does implicit allocation of fair shares, and packet_pair does implicit determination of the fair share for flow control. In contrast, current proposals in the ATM Forum for flow control do neither round robin (considered to be too expensive) nor implicit determination of the rate (only possible with round robin). Maybe I was wrong the whole time ;-) I have been working since 1991 in building ATM networks. IDLInet source code is now in the public domain and is available from the Native-mode ATM home page . The key feature in IDLInet is that the protocol stack is native-mode ATM, that is, an application gets to write directly to an ATM virtual circuit. Links Papers Here is a link to my papers. REAL I have been building the REAL packet-level simulator since 1989 and still maintain it. It has been installed at over 300 sites (I have no idea how many people actually use it). Here is a link to REAL version 4.0. You can also get the simulator from here . Version 5 is in the works, includes a Tcl-based GUI, and should be out by the end of '96 (if all goes well). Native_mode ATM Home Page My Name In the part of the world I come from (South India, Thanjavur District, to be precise), people have only one name. Thus, my only name is Keshav, and my father's name is Srinivasan.
