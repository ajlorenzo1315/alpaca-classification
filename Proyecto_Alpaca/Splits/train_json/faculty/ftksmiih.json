    "Cuerpo": "Current Activities Current Research Recent Publications Current Research Broadly speaking, my research interest is the theory of algorithms, including many aspects of computational complexity theory. I am mostly working on combinatorial optimization problems, in particular network problems, approximation algorithms, and linear and integer programming problems.
