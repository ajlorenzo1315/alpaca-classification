Recent work has included approximation algorithms for routing and disjoint paths problems in networks; adversarial queueing theory, an approach to analyzing the stability of network routing protocols without probabilistic assumptions; geometric methods in combinatorial optimization, particularly the use of positive semi-definite programming; and geometric algorithms for studying molecular conformation.
