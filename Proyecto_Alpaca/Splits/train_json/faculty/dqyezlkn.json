The Next Generation Internetworking During 1987-92,  my students and I worked on a research project concerned with the design of the next generation of internet architecture. (If you are interested in RSVP and Integrated Services work in IETF, you should look at our earlier work.) Design and implementation of gateway architectures that can support data rates of a few hundred Mbps, can interface with diverse networks, and can implement the congram-oriented service without becoming a performance bottleneck. For details on our work on a ATM-FDDI gateway, click here . Development of analytical and simulation models to evaluate important tradeoffs associated with the design of a congram-oriented protocol, the resource management on diverse networks, and the design of new gateway architectures.

FAVORITE QUOTES Admiration: Our polite recognition of another's resemblance to ourselves. A model is an artifice for helping you convince yourself that you understand more about a system than you do.",
