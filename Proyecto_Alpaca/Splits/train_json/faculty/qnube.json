If you have a CISE account, then cd to ~davis/Minix1.7.4/MinixRoot to see the same thing (allows you to \"grep\" the source code, see the MinixRoot README file for more information). Click here for sparse matrices and patterns. Our web site gives you static pictures of sparse matrices - the advantage being that you don't have to download the whole matrix. Related AMD variants (not AMD itself, however) are available for non-commercial use in NETLIB and via anonymous ftp at this site . UMFPACK: a package for solving sparse linear systems: ********* Version 2.0 is now released! (Sept. 13, 1995) ********** ********* Version 2.1(Beta) is also released (Dec. 7, 1995) ********** See T. A. Davis and I. S. Duff, \"A combined unifrontal/multifrontal method for unsymmetric sparse matrices\", TR-95-020, Submitted to ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, for more information. It requires the BLAS, and two subroutines from the Harwell MA28 code (MC21B and MC13E, available from NETLIB). For commercial use, UMFPACK Version 2.0 will soon appear as MA38 be placed in the Harwell Subroutine Library. A Beta release of UMFPACK Version 2.1 is now available (only by ftp, not in NETLIB). The primary difference with Version 2.0 is that COMPLEX and COMPLEX*16 versions are included in UMFPACK Version 2.1. Note that the complex versions will not appear in the next release of the Harwell Subroutine Library (for which January 1996 is the target date). UMFPACK Version 2.0 is also in NETLIB. UMFPACK Versions 1.0 and 1.1 are no longer available, nor supported. Click here for a list of related technical reports. For best performance of UMFPACK, you should use vendor-optimized BLAS. Note that the UF copy might not be the most recent, although I will try to keep it up-to-date. Click here for more information about the optimized BLAS. The two packages are written by Mark Law in the VLSI/TCAD Group of the Electrical Engingeering Department of the University of Florida . (NOTE THE CHANGE OF AREA CODE from 904 to 352).",
