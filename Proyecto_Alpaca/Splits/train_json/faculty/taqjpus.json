    "Cuerpo": "Look for some of my former or present students . Selected recent articles on approximation theory written at UW are available by anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.wisc.edu/Approx . The read.me file provides access to individual files there at the click of a button (it's a clickable version of the read.me file there). Click here for a list of errata for the third edition of [Conte and de Boor, Elementary Numerical Analysis: An Algorithmic Approach ], and here for that list of errata for the various printings of [Carl de Boor, A Practical Guide to Splines ]. Check out the latest versions of the various programs and drivers in that latter book. Click Journal of Approximation Theory (published by Academic Press ) for information about that journal (including recently accepted and published papers) as well as for email and postal addresses of many approximators and much, much more. Ditto for Constructive Approximation (published by Springer-Verlag ). Ditto for East Journal on Approximations . Search their tables of content, singly or combined, (and thank Paul Nevai for this handy tool). There is also Approximation down under and Amos Ron 's list of homepages of approximators . There are also on-screen tutorials . But the html-primer might be even better. For a very unusual and ever_changing home page, try David Griffeath's Primordial Soup Kitchen . For various interesting information, see odds and ends , and thank Allan Pinkus at pinkus@techunix.technion.ac.il or Paul Nevai if you find any of it useful. Also, check out Paul Nevai's way to make his mathematical output available. COURSES Check here for information about MATH/CS 717 . Click here for information about Numerical Analysis here at CS . *) The house next door to Iso's is now occupied by Takis Souganides and Thaleia Zariphopoulou . The Szego bust now stands here . Have a look at the inscription .",
