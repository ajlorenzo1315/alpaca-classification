Carter Assistant Professor Computer Science Department University of Utah Professor Carter joined the Department of Computer Science in January 1993. The development of an efficient and highly portable distributed shared memory system, Quarks , is part of this effort. Current Research Projects Avalanche Scalable Multiprocessor Design: The goal of this project to develop an integrated cache, memory, and communication architecture that significantly reduces the latency of both distributed shared memory and message passage multiprocessor communication. Fast and Flexible Mach-Based Systems: The goal of this project is to develop an operating system that provides a much higher degree of flexibility than traditional operating systems, and to use that added flexibility to circumvent the performance/functionality tradeoffs that thwart traditional highly-decomposed, microkernel-based operating systems. Quarks Distributed Shared Memory System: The goal of this project is to develop an efficient, portable, and freely available distributed shared memory system to support the shared memory programming style on distributed memory multiprocessors and networks of workstations. Primary research collaborators: Willy Zwaenepoel and John Bennett . Optimistic Bulk Data Transfer Protocol: The key insight exploited in this effort was that when the first packet in a `blast' of bulk data is received by a node, it is highly likely that no packet outside the `blast' will arrive before the last bulk data packet is received.
