    "Cuerpo": "He received his Ph.D. in education and computer science (a joint degree) at the University of Michigan in 1993, where he developed Emile , an environment for high school science learners programming multimedia demonstrations and physics simulations. Mark is a member of the GVU Center , the Cognitive Science program , and the EduTech Institute . Mark recently co-organized a workshop with Rick Weingarten of Computing Research Association for the National Science Foundation. The charge of the workshop was to set a research agenda for Computer Science in Educational Technology. Current Areas of Interest Educational computing, software-realized scaffolding, construction and design environments for students, constructionism, collaboration support, log file analysis and visualization, computational science (computer modeling, simulation, and visualization) for students Mark Guzdial's current research centers on facilitating student learning through student design, construction, and analysis of artifacts. He has developed simulation environments for learning science through construction, and is now exploring visualization and collaboration environments to facilitate science and engineering learning. Recent Classes with Interesting Home Pages CS 2390 Modeling and Design, Winter '96 which is where, WebCaMILE was first used in CS 2390. CS 2390 Modeling and Design, Spring '96 where STABLE was first used. CS 6398, Design and Evaluation of Educational Software CS 2390 Modeling and Design, Fall '96 Current Research Projects NSF Multimedia Courseware Project : With John Stasko and Jim Foley, I am working on creating effective multimedia courseware for Computer Science courses using WWW. In collaboration with Elliot Soloway, Kenneth E. Hay, and Yasmin Kafai, an interface design emphasis on learner-centered design is evolving, part of which is software-realized scaffolding. CaMILE (Collaborative and Multimedia Interactive Learning Environment) is a new learning environment designed to support students in collaboration with multimedia annotations. DEVICE (Dynamic Environment for Visualization in Chemical Engineering : DEVICE is an environment in which Chemical Engineering students learn through a process of design in a simulated world. Generalized Scaffolding: STABLE is a first attempt at creating generalized scaffolding -- not modifying the environment, but providing scaffolding, multiple representations, generic \"plan\" libraries (a la GPCeditor or Emile), and collaborative environments in support of an existing work environment (VisualWorks Smalltalk). STABLE is being tested in CS 2390 during Spring '96. Instructions on how to create STABLE cases are available. MediaText is a multimedia composition environment for grades 6-12 students. Mark designed MediaText with Elliot, and MediaText is now a commercial product developed by Constructive Instruments and distributed by Apple Computer and Wings for Learning. Emile is a programming environment for science students exploring physics by creating simulations. My family album. (Updated October, 1996)",
