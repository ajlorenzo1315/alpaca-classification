Katz Research Interests Faculty Book Club Courses Recent Publications Selected Publications Selected Talks Professor Randy H. Katz Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department Department Chairman and The United Microelectronics Corporation Distinguished Professor Ph.D., University of Californa, Berkeley, 1980. A. After my Ph.D., and some career fits and starts, I landed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I shifted my interests into VLSI and CAD, in particular, database support for VLSI CAD environments. Since that time, my research and teaching interests have focused on the design, engineering, and implementation of advanced high performance computing systems. Between 1985 and 1989, I led the design of the distributed cache and virtual memory organization of the SPUR multiprocessor project. Between 1987 and 1992, I led the design and implementation of the Berkeley RAID (Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks) high performance storage system (we coined the term \"RAID\"). This work was done in overall collaboration with Dave Patterson and John Ousterhout. Click here for a picture of \"RAID the First\" and here for a picture of \"RAID the Second,\" which is still functional in 1996. Unsatisfied with academic life \"as usual,\" and after the elections of 1992, I decided to take a leave during 1993-1994 at the Computing Systems Technology Office (now \"Information Technology Office\") of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency .

On July 1, 1996, I became the first Computer Scientist to be the Chair of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The overall effort, in collaboration with Eric Brewer, is called the Daedalus Project . Heterogeneous Collaboration Environments With Steve McCanne, who is joining the faculty this year, we are studying how to extend the technology we have developed for adapting data representations in real-time into a comprehensive open framework for collaboration.
