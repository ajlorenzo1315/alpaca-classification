Konheim Department of Computer Science University of California at Santa Barbara Telephone :     (805) 893-3560 Internet : konheim@cs.ucsb. and M.S. While a Research Staff Member in the Mathematical Sciences Department at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights (1960-82), he was a visiting Fellow in Mathematics at the California Institute of Technology (1962) and a Senior Fulbright Scholar at the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics at the University of Heidelberg (1966). Dr. Konheim's professional interests span several areas in Computer Science. His early work at IBM was related to the application of neural-like networks (Perceptrons) to pattern-recognition problems. The analysis of computer algorithms evaluated methods for improving the efficiency of storage schema (hashing, padded lists, sparse tables and disk access). IBM's Liberty Banking Systems included a cryptographic function based on the LUCIFER algorithm developed by his group at the Yorktown Research Center. This work led to the Data Encryption Standard which was evaluated by his Yorktown Probability and Cryptography Group and certified as a National Standard in the 1970's. In 1970, he began to study the performance of computer communication systems while on sabbatical at the IBM Zurich Laboratory. His current research interests include (i) the effect of interference of virtual circuits in window-based flow control, (ii) the performance of packet-radio networks, (iii) input rate control for B-ISDN, (iv) estimation of rates with heterogeneous ATM traffic at the uni and (v) enhancing the thruput in fast packet switches. He is a member of the MAA, ACM, SIAM and a Senior Member of the IEEE. He is on the editorial board of The Mathematical Scientist and the Telecommunications Research Journal . Patents.
