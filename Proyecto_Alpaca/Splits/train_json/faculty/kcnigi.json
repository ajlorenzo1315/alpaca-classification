Skeel Profile Robert Skeel received his Ph.D. from the University of Alberta in 1974. He is a professor in the Department of Computer Science at UIUC and a part-time Beckman Institute faculty member in the Theoretical Biophysics Group . His fields of professional interest are scientific computing and numerical analysis: computational methods for biomolecular modeling. Recent, Representative Publications With M. Nelson, W. Humphrey, A. Gursoy, A. Dalke, L. Kale, K. Schulten , and R. Kufrin, \"MDScope-A Visual Computing Environment for Structural Biology,\" Comput. Phys. Commun ., 91 (1995), pp. With D. Okunbor, \"Canonical Numerical Methods for Molecular Dynamics Simulations,\" J. Comput. Chem. , 15 (1994), pp. Phys. , 109 (1993), pp. Beckman Institute Research KEY WORDS: Molecular dynamics, macromolecular modeling, computational structural biology, numerical analysis, parallel algorithms. Robert Skeel is interested in computational methods for biomolecular modeling, which is of great importance in structural biology and drug design and require the use of high-performance computers. The goal is to find faster ways to do the computations, especially through the application of advanced numerical techniques, and parallel algorithms. Current work centers on further development of NAMD -an object-oriented parallel molecular dynamics program, which is part of MDScope-a computational environment for structural biology. This work is done in collaboration with L. V. Kale, Klaus Schulten , and other members of the Theoretical Biophysics Group . In the future it is also hoped that a systematic way can be found to reduce the degrees of freedom. : 217-333-2727 email: skeel@cs.uiuc.edu Robert Skeel's Department of Computer Science homepage contains additional information.
