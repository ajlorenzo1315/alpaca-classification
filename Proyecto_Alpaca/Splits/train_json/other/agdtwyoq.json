The dimensions of the box are twenty by twenty by one unit deep. The areas shaded blue represent fluid moving downwards, and those shaded red represent fluid moving up. Green is motionless fluid;  at the boundary the fluid is constrained to be motionless, so we will eventually see all of the patterns fading out at the boundary. The convection rolls that ultimately form have diameter comparable to the depth of the box. Frame 0 . Frame 1 . Frame 2 . Frame 3 . The rolls become locally parallel, but defects form in the center of the box. Frame 4 . Frame 5 . The fluid eventually reaches a steady state. These evolutions also make spiffy movies. Unfortunately, to make them small enough to be reasonable over the network, the geometries are so small that the fluid motion is a little contrived. Here's one with rigid boundary conditions (as above, only smaller). The second picture plainly shows the specific effect we're trying to pin down, the bending of the convection rolls as they leave the boundary. A. Rigid/rigid boundaries (Picture only.)
