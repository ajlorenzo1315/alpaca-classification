However, there is a one to one correspondence between the set of all natural numbers and the set of all perfect squares. So then what is mathematics about? Hence, the limit of: 1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, 1.4142, ... is the set: {1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, 1.4142, ... } and: Weierstrass also introduced the - definition of a limit: if for all  > 0, there exists a  > 0 such that for all t: implies We are now back to the Pythagorean idea of a single theory based on numerical concepts. All rational numbers are in either set A or set B , none are in both, and all elements of A are less than all elements of B . For example: is defined by sets { A , B }, such that: A is the set of all rational numbers x, with x 2 < 2, and B is the set of all rational numbers y, with y 2 > 2. Two developments that this leads to are: 1)\tInvestigation of the notion of infinite sets as numbers and that an infinite set can be a number. A denumerable set (sometimes called enumerable ) is one that can be put into a one to one correspondence with the set of natural numbers. The set of R is larger than N;  in fact there are more real numbers between zero and one than there are total natural numbers. List all natural numbers down left side, and give corresponding real number to each's right: 1\t\t0.a 1 1 a 2 1 a 3 1 a 4 1 a 5 1 a 6 1 ..... 2\t\t0.a 1 2 a 2 2 a 3 2 a 4 2 a 5 2 a 6 2 ..... 3\t\t0.a 1 3 a 2 3 a 3 3 a 4 3 a 5 3 a 6 3 ..... 4\t\t0.a 1 4 a 2 4 a 3 4 a 4 4 a 5 4 a 6 4 ..... 5\t\t0.a 1 5 a 2 5 a 3 5 a 4 5 a 5 5 a 6 5 ..... 6\t\t0.a 1 6 a 2 6 a 3 6 a 4 6 a 5 6 a 6 6 ..... etc. Cantor's Notation: = 0 (the cardinal number of the natural numbers (37) ) = 0 = Note that this notation is linked to the fact that: P{1,2,3} = 8 = 2 # of elements The set of function from R to R = Another reason for this notation is that we haven't yet proved that there is no set A such that: (38) 0 Additionally, Cantor showed how to do arithmetic with the infinities: 0 + 0 = {0,2,4,...}  {1,3,5,...} = {0,1,2,3,4,...} = 0 0 2 = 0 0 = 0 . For example, the set of natural numbers are of the same order-type as the set of even numbers because there exists an order-preserving one to one correspondence between the two sets (i.e. 0  0, 1  2, 2  4, 3  6, etc. A conceptual foundation for the calculus was provided-- all notions of mathematics was reduced to the ideas of natural numbers and the (possibly infinite) set. What are natural numbers? In structuralism, to be a natural number, is to be a place in the  sequence. Logic, and number theory are part of real mathematics. Thus, Hilbert's Program does not work;  one cannot prove the consistency of a mathematical theory. However, in order for Brouwer's theorem to hold, he must show that the function is not defined at some point on the interval. This view of the real number line is the same as Aristotle's. 46-52 Brouwer's 37 Brouwer's Doctrine 46 Brouwer's Theory of Consciousness 46 Calculus, Invention of 21 Cantor, George 28, 29, 32 Cardinal
