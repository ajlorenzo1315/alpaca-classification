Grading : The course grade will be roughly determined as follows: Assignments (written and laboratory): 20% Midterm Exam: 15% Project: 60% Participation and intangibles: 5% Project : The main emphasis in this course is the design, construction and documentation of a substantial project which will need to be demonstrated by Friday, June 7. In the first part of the course, you will be using the lab for lab assignments. Although there are scheduled lab hours during which we will talk about the various tools and equipment, you are generally free to do the lab assignments at your own convenience. Each pair of students will check out a DesignKit for the quarterthat will contain everything needed to complete the laboratory assignments (kits will be available during the first week of the quarter.) The lab is there to be used by you and your fellow students. Make sure you treat everything in the lab with respect---from your fellow students to the equipment and parts you will be using. Please make sure to keep the entry code to yourself. Only students registered for #70, 467, or 477 should be allowed into the lab and the windows and doors should be locked at all times. If you are all good citizens we should be able to have flexible access and a secure environment. Any problems with laboratory equipment and/or software should be immediately reported to him. If we are not available, call the University Police at 911. And remember do not let anyone into the lab no matter how hard they knock at the door. Parts and Money : You will need to pay us $20 to defray the cost of the commercial software you will be using and a $100 security deposit for the DesignKits you will be issued and other materials, parts, tools, quipment, and documentation you may check out from the lab. These will be due by the first laboratory meeting this week. The $100 checks will be returned at the end of the quarter when the DesignKits and any other parts, equipment, or documentation borrowed in the interim are return in good shape. The kits will be available the first week of class. If you have our blessing, you will be re-imbursed for the parts you buy for your project. IF you intend to keep your project, then you will have to buy all the parts including those that may have come with your DesignKit.",
