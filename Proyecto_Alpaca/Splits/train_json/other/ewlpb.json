Sapporo (Hokkaido) This is where I was born. Sapporo is located at the north part of Japan. It is as cold and as snowy as Ithaca. We can get fresh seafood such as clab, delicious Ramen (noodle), and delicious corn. We have snow festival in February. Nagoya (Aichi) This is where I spent my life as a junior school student. Nagoya is very hot and humid. One of the famous buildings here is Nakano Sun Plaza, a triangle building. Tetsugakudo park is a beautiful park. Tokorozawa (Saitama) This is where I spent my life as a university student, and where my parents live. Fuji. It is north west of Tokyo(.5 to 1 hr). Machida, Yamato(Kanagawa) This is where I've lived since I joined IBM Japan. My office is in Yamato. It is south west of Tokyo, and also close to Yokohama (.5 hr). Ithaca (NY, USA) This is where I live now. It is a nice, rural place, 4 hrs north west from New York City. We can concentrate on studying because we have no temptation such as Karaoke, Mahjong, bar, etc. It is also close to Niagara Fall(3 hrs) and Toronto(4 hrs).",
