These are: The new block in the file that contains the data to be written. The disk block free list. Get the disk block from the free list. Recovering from a Crash When an operating system crashes, it often leaves the data that it stores on the disk in an inconsistent state. By inconsistent state, we mean that file system data structures do not correctly describe what should be in the files, directories, descriptors, and free lists. This can happen because it takes several disk reads and writes to update a file, its inodes (file descriptors), and the free list. When the operating system is rebooted, it is necessary to validate that the file system and its data structures are all right (or figure out how to fix them). With an allocation scheme based on block groups and a free block bit-map (such as that used in DEMOS), is it possible to tell, after a crash, if a block that is marked \"free\" in the bit-map should not be? If not, why not? If you first removed a block from the bitmap (as we did in the Question 1), then you know that if a block is marked \"free\", then it should really be a free block. Start at the root directory and traverse the file system tree. At each descriptor, record in the new bit-map which disk blocks are allocated for that descriptor. Compare the new bit-map to the one that is on disk. This will show files that should be in bit-map but are not, and files that are in the bit-map but should not be. As you can see, from the last step above, we can tell which blocks are really free and which are allocated to a file. After a crash, suppose we know that a disk block appears both in the free list/map and in a file. If so, what? If a block occurs in both the free list and only one file, then it is usually safe to take it out of the free list and keep it in the file. Last modified: Thu May  2 10:58:15 CDT 1996 by bart",
