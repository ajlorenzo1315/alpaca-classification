It is the student's responsibility to satisfy all requirements of the Computer Science Department and the Graduate College. REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION In addition to the requirements listed in the Catalog, students must satisfy the following requirements: a Bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university; successful completion of an 8-hour calculus sequence; either a \"B\" average or better during the last two years of studies or a substantial demonstration of mature performance in an industrial environment; a TOEFL score of 550 or better for international students; an undergraduate major in computer science or significant course work or work experience in computer science. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS The M.S. The course work must include: core courses - 12 credit hours - 5113 or 5253, 5313, 5323, and 5413; elective courses - 12 credit hours; and M.S. thesis research courses - 6 credit hours. Only one \"C\" is accepted in a core course, and it must be offset by an \"A\" in a core course. Prior to enrolling in the 17th hour of course work, a student must select a graduate faculty member from within the department to serve as the student's principal advisor. The committee members approve the student's Plan of Study and give final approval for the student's degree. The advisory committee must approve the student's performance on the Oral Qualifying Exam and the Final Oral Exam. The advisory committee can be changed by the student by submitting a new plan of study before the Oral Qualifying Exam. After the exam, any changes in the committee must be approved by the Graduate Committee. Oral Qualifying Exam:  The oral qualifying examination is not an examination in the true sense of the word, but a proposal for the work to be completed for the M.S. The written proposal should be delivered to all committee members at least one week prior to the presentation. If the proposed research is not approved by the committee, a second attempt cannot be retaken in less than one month after the failed examination, nor more than twelve months after the failed examination. The written thesis must be delivered to all committee members at least one week prior to the presentation. The presentation must be at least sixty days after the Oral Qualifying Exam. After the presentation, committee members may ask additional questions over material covered in both core courses and courses listed on the Plan of Study. If the student fails, a second attempt cannot be retaken in less than one month after the failed examination, nor more than twelve months after the failed examination.
