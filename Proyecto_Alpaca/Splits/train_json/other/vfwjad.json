    "Cuerpo": "Here is another set of images , with corresponding squared-gradient magnitude image. These images are also available in ~jmiller/test2 on the cs and sunlab machines. I would prefer that you just create symbolic links to the images if you can, since they exceed 3MB. \"ln -s ~jmiller/test2 .\" Here is the first set of images, available in a tar file . There are two sets of stereo images that you can use to test your motion calculations. There is a sequence called dots that is a moving box on a random background. There is also the coke-can images along with the dx,dy, and squared gradient magnitude images for the coke can. You can use the squared gradient magnitude image as a simple external energy field for snakes that are attracted to edges. (Also available on the sunlab in ~jmiller/664/ps2). Problem Set 2: MINI-FAQ Mask for census transform. *     - - x - - - -  (2,0) *     - x - x - x -  (1,1) (3,1) (5,1) *     - - x - x - x  (2,2) (4,2) (6,2) *     x - x P - x -  (0,3) (2,3) (5,3) *     - x - x - x -  (1,4) (3,4) (5,4) *     - - x - x - -  (2,5) (4,5) *     - - - x - - -  (3,6) * * Input: a pgm image * Output: a ShortInt image containing the census transform of the *   input, representing each comparison using on bit. The correct approach is to take a set of point positions , run algorithm II, and using the output set of point positions from alg. II, feed it into alg. Do this until the energy stops decreasing. The squared gradient images I have given you are images smoothed with a gaussian mask (sigma = 2.0). Using the ADT image libraries The following versions of the library are available SunOS available on the cs dept machines as ~robotlab/new/lib/libadt.a, with the appropriate header files in ~robotlab/new/include/adt/ . Sunlab: located in ~jmiller/664/libadt.a, with header files in ~jmiller/664/include. Solaris available on the cs dept machines as ~robotlab/new/lib/libadt-svr4.a, with the appropriate header files in ~robotlab/new/include/adt/ , be sure to include -DSVR4 on your command line . Linux: Here is the (ELF) library and a tarfile containing the header files .",
