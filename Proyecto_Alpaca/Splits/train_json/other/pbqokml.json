    "Cuerpo": "For this assignment you are to write a program to compute the wind-chill factor (WCF) from the current temperature and wind speed . The WCF indicates how cold it will feel if you are outside on a windy day. Your program will ask the user to enter the current temperature in degrees Fahrenheit followed by the wind speed in mph. Both values should be read in as INTEGER s.  Your program will then compute and print the WCF in degrees Fahrenheit given by the formula where Vel is the wind speed and Temp is the temperature. After you print the WCF in degrees Fahrenheit convert this temperature to degrees Celsius and print it using the formula The values you compute for the WCF in deg. F and deg. In particular, if the wind speed is less than 10 mph then it is \"calm\", less than 20 mph then it is \"windy\", or greater than or equal to 20 mph then it is \"very windy\". F then it is \"bitterly cold\", less than 10 deg. Example: If the current temperature is 11 deg. F and the wind speed is 17 mph then your program should display (hint: use this to check your results) The wind-chill factor is          -21 deg. F The wind-chill factor is          -30 deg. C The weather is windy      and bitterly cold Do worry if you get extra spaces in your output as shown above. Important - Make sure you copy the correct versions of your program files because these are what will be graded. You also have to hand in a printed copy of your FORTRAN source code file and a printed copy of the output when your program is run with the five sets of test data given in the gradesheet. Note that you will be graded on correct output for the input values given below, so before handing it in you must run your program with these values and manually check that your program gives the correct results in every case (e.g. use a calculator). F, wind speed = 7 mph            [4] temperature = 32 deg. F, wind speed = 10 mph          [4] temperature = -16 deg. F, wind speed = 20 mph         [4] temperature = -6 deg. F, wind speed = 12 mph          [4] temperature = -16 deg.
