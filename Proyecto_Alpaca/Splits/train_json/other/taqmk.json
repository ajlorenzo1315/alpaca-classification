It will take some work to make things go smoothly, but I believe that you will find doing your work this way much more fun, interesting and ultimately rewarding. Whether you are on the giving or receiving end of an explanation from a friend, you will be learning more than if you were working alone. In your first group meeting you should spend some time talking about how you are going to work. You must meet at least once a week - the lab section is a natural place to at least touch base, but I would plan to use a good half-hour of this time for a group meeting. This position can rotate among the group members if you like,  but there needs to be one person who takes the lead scheduling meetings and deciding on how the group should proceed. At the end of the first week, the group leader must send me the group's list of goals and expectations. Every two weeks, the group should take the time to assess how they are working together and decide on any changes. But if the group feels that one or two people have done more than their share, then they should indicate this. I will not pay great attention to this unless the amounts are way out of balance. I know that many students resist the idea of working in groups. Here are some arguments often raised and my answer to them: Why should I do the work and someone else get the credit? Grades are not curved in this course. Why should I have to get along with them to get a grade. Almost any job you take, outside of forest ranger, will require you to work with others whether you like them or not. Working in groups takes too much time. It will take time at first to adjust to the group dynamics. You should spend some time at first deciding how you are going to work together and what role each person is going to have. I don't want to have to rely on someone else to do their part. If a team member consistently lets down the rest of the group, then their name should not appear on the assignment.",
