See also consultant schedules . The C language compiler is Microsoft's Visual C++ (MSVC), version 4.2. Consultants will be on duty in the lab frequently during the week. There are also lab assistants on duty to check users in and out, to answer questions about operating the equipment, and to retrieve print-outs. To take the course, you will NOT be required to purchase MSVC, but if you would like to, version 4.0 is available in the University Bookstore at an educational discount. Currently the price is about $55.00 plus tax. Version 4.2 is used in the IPL, but the differences should not cause any difficulties for students in this course. (This compiler will also be used for CSE 143 beginning in Winter Quarter 1997.) Platforms other than Win95 with MSVC 4.2 can be used, such as a Macintosh with the Symantec Think C compiler, or a PC with Borland C++. Regardless of your home equipment, there may still be times when you will need to come to the computer lab in person. Macintosh Lab (Sieg 324) 324 Sieg (543-9472). Hours are posted at the door.

You may choose to use this lab, but there will be no 142 consultants on duty, and in general the level of support from 142 staff will be low. Other labs on campus The Academic Computer Center (Brooklyn & Pacific) has some PCs and a C++ compiler. They are generally open 24 hours a day (except in summer). Hours for the ACC and other labs are available on-line . Many other computing services and facilities are available at UW.
