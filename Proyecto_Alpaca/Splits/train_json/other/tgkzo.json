    "TÃ­tulo": "I had a Dream",
    "Cuerpo": "I did not dream that this new computer friend would be a means of making money for me or my employer, or a help for my country -- though I loved my country then and still do, and I have no objection to making money. When I awoke from this day dream I found that we didn't have these things, but we did have some remarkable computers, even then, so I decided then and there to quit my job and set about spending the rest of my life helping bring this dream to reality. You know this still seems possible to me now;  that's what really drives me. And I don't mind that, in fact the economic interest might just push forward part of the needed research. I don't have to explain why I had (and have) this dream, I just do. That is what is exciting, doing the possible. Some of this has happened already,  and I believe that we have in this room the talent to bring about much of the rest of it. These are things that are important to me in my  \"calling\"  as an AI researcher. Because knowledge is king, knowledge - the key to who we are. Even reasoning itself is enhanced by knowledge about reasoning, and knowledge about what we are reasoning about. So what is new about AI?\" The answer is that the AI scientist or engineer recognizes this knowledge for what it is, and has, in the case of expert systems, plucked it out of the program and placed it in a separate  \"knowledge base\". Indeed, almost all of our AI accomplishments have been of the partial kind:  natural language processors which handle a subset of English (or French, etc);  systems that recognize and synthesize limited forms of speech;  character recognition machines that read only typewritten characters;  expert systems which perform a variety of tasks (but not all that a human can);   theorem provers that can prove difficult theorems in a particular area of mathematics,or which can handle the inferencing needed for elementary expert systems, including non-monotonic reasoning;  programs that play expert level chess;  programs that exhibit an elementary level of learning and reasoning by analogy. Such a knowledge base should contain  \"common sense\" knowledge as well as encyclopedic and expert knowledge, and be structured to handle the learning and performance requirements mentioned above. So we must press on in other areas of AI as well as machine learning. Causality is another important research area in AI. I mean expert systems which have been endowed with: large structured knowledge bases; ability to reason through various causality levels (preferring the shallowest but resorting to deeper levels as needed); limited ability to learn automatically from experience and to accumulate knowledge by analogy; truth maintenance systems; enhanced human interfacing to facilitate knowledge acquisition from experts and for ease of use; etc. IMPORTANT RESEARCH AREAS Large Structured Knowledge Bases Knowledge Representation Knowledge Storage, Retrieval, and Use Expert Systems Technology (A large Effort) Machine Learning Controlled by knowledge structures Causality By depth levels Human Interfacing Natural Language Processing Speech Recognition and Generation Automatic Reasoning Analogical Reasoning Common Sense Reasoning, Default Reasoning I have not tried to be complete in this listing and have not even mentioned some important areas such as robotics, automatic programming, and planning. But the requirements for reasoning about knowledge will be intensified and partly satisfied by these new high speed provers that are beginning to appear. What is the most important characteristic of a good researcher?",
