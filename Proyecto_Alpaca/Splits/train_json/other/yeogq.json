    "Cuerpo": "A \"catch phrase\" is a phrase that is repeated in more than one episode of MST3K with no significant content alterations. A good rule of thumb: if you can use the phase in several conversations without changing it at all, it's probably a good catch phrase. The reason is that I intend this to be a Catch Phrase Catalog, not a Catch Phrase Sources Catalog. Are you talking to me? ( Planet of the Apes ) Do not bring your evil here. Don't look at me! Don't you look at me! (Star Trek, TOS) I am not an animal! I don't know how it works! I like you--that's why I'm going to kill you last. I'm hysterical, and I'm wet, and I'm in pain! [w/ OK hand gesture] (Pod People) It's... (Monty Python) It's a mad house! ( Planet of the Apes ) It's fun. It's hot and it hurts and stuff. That was me... Ouch! This is gonna be my new Saturday night thing. ( Citizen Kane ) You... are going... to die! Because I... am going... to KILL you! You have *got* to be kidding me! ( Planet of the Apes ) You die Joe!",
