    "Cuerpo": "Others think a \"Home Page\" is a page you create for your own use that contains a list of links to the sites you visit frequently. Step 0: What you should have in front of you. You will probably want to read both this document and the page you are editing at the same time, so to make that easier you can create a second Mosaic window. If you have never put a document on the Web, you will need to create your publicly accessible WWW directory. Step 3: Edit the home page file. In the other Mosaic window there should be a short list of directories and files, one of which is username .html . Just as the string ~ username /public/html/ is a complete path in the filesystem pointing to the directory you created, the string http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ username / is a complete path (or full URL ) to that same directory in the Web namespace. If you had wanted to load the document directly, you could have entered http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ username / username .html However, the server was nice enough to make a directory listing for you, so you can just click on the name of the file to view it. As you read it, look for examples in the file: Markup in HTML is done with Elements and Entities . While there is a blank line between paragraphs in the sample file, it is the <P> tags that cause space to be included in the Mosaic window. The third line of the sample home page looks like this: <TITLE>Felix's Home Page</TITLE> If you look at the top of your Mosaic window where it says \" Document Title: \" you will see that the string in the TITLE container is displayed there. From now on, whenever you make changes to the file you can save it in your editor and reload it into your browser to see the result. The body is everything between the <BODY> and </BODY> tags (if you look at the end of the document, you will see the </BODY> tag). The body is where you put your text, entities, and most of the elements. The sample file has a number of elements you might want to use in your own home page. Don't delete a sample element until you have left at least one example of its use in the file or decided you don't want to use it. As you look at the sample page in your editor and in Mosaic it should become clear what the different elements do in Mosaic for X . Here is a list of the elements in the document and what they do in Mosaic: <B> is a container that emboldens its contents. There are also a number of elements not included in the sample document. If you had a GIF file called me.gif , and you wanted to include it in your document, you could put it in the same directory where the document is located, and use the tag <IMG SRC=\"me.gif\"> .",
