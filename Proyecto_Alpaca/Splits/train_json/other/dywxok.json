    "Cuerpo": "Prerequisites : A working knowledge of Boolean algebra and finite-state machines. Familiarity with the department's computing environment: Unix/X Course Goals : To provide in-depth understanding of digital systems and their design, including specification, synthesis, and implementation. Facilities : You will be making extensive use of computer-aided design (CAD) tools for designing and implementing digital circuits. These are (mostly) located in Sieg 424 but are accessible from any X-terminal. You may find it advantageous to work in 424 where you can take advantage of manuals, reference texts and the knowledge of other students. CAD Tools : CAD tools allow us to design and implement substantial hardware projects in a reasonable amount of time. They also provide hands-on experience with state-of-the-art design tools that incorporate the synthesis algorithms covered in class. These tools are introduced during the first half of the course as basic concepts are covered and then used heavily for the design project. Synopsys The Synopsys synthesis tools are used to synthesize implementations from the Verilog descriptions. This course uses Synopsys to investigate the synthesis process as well as a ``turn-key'' synthesis for implementing the final project. Assignments : There will be weekly assignments and labs during the first half of the quarter. They will give you experience with the concepts you will be using in the second half of the quarter for the design project and introduce you to the CAD tools. Project : A substantial part of the course revolves around the team design of a large hardware systems project. Each team will design a complete project using schematics and Verilog for specification, Verilog-XL for simulation, the Synopsys tools for synthesis, and Xilinx FPGAs for implementation. This quarter we will be designing hardware to implement an image processing algorithm. I haven't decided which algorithm yet, but examples include compression, filtering, edge detection, etc. An image will be downloaded into the on-board RAM, transformed by the hardware into a compressed or filtered image, and then uploaded to the Alpha. Each member of the team will be responsible for the performance of all other team members; that is, the entire team must understand the solution and contribute to part of it. As compensation, there will be no mid-term exam. Grading : The course grade will be roughly determined as follows: Assignments (homework and laboratory): 20% Quizzes: 20% Project: 40% Final Exam: 20% Participation and intangibles: 10% ebeling@cs.washington.edu",
