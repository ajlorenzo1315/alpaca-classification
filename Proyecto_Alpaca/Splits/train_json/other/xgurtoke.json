    "Cuerpo": "In Pacifica , the Court specifically ruled that the First Amendment did not prevent government regulation of that broadcast based on its content, even though -- the monologue constituted \"speech\" within the meaning of the First Amendment, 438 U.S. at 744; the radio station had warned listeners immediately before the broadcast, 438 U.S. at 730; the material did not have \"prurient appeal\", and was not \"obscene, ..., indecent, filthy or vile\" within the meaning of the federal statutes pertaining to obscene mail, 438 U.S. at 740; the monologue was not \"obscene in the constitutional sense\", 438 U.S. at 756 (Powell, J., concurring); the Commission's objections were based in part on the content of the broadcast, 438 U.S. at 744; a radio broadcast, \"unlike other intrusive methods of communication, '... can be turned off,' 438 U.S. at 765 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (citing Lehman v. Shaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298, 302 (1974)); the decision \"has the ... effect of making completely unavailable to adults material which may not constitutionally be kept even from children,\" 438 U.S. at 769 (Brennan, J., dissenting); the Court's \"rationales could justify the banning from radio of a myriad of literary works, novels, poems, and plays by the likes of Shakespeare, Joyce, Hemingway, Ben Jonson, Henry Fielding, Robert Burns, and Chaucer;\", 438 U.S. at 771 (Brennan, J., dissenting) The remainder of this page excerpts (in direct quote) from this landmark opinion. As you read these opinions (majority, concurring, and dissenting), remember that although you may or may not agree with the reasoning, the Court squarely held that the monologue in question was not \"speech\" protected by the First Amendment . ...The Commission ... expressed the opinion that it should be regulated...  \"[T]he concept of 'indecent' is intimately connected with he exposure of children to language that describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities and organs, at times of the day when there is a reasonable risk that children may be in the audience.\" (Laughter)  Okay, I was thinking one night about the words you couldn't say on the public, ah, airwaves, um, the ones you definitely wouldn't say, ever, [`]cause I heard a lady say bitch one night on television, and it was cool like she was talking about, you know, ah, well, the bitch is the first one to notice that in the litter Johnie right (murmur) Right. And, uh, bastard you can say, and hell and damn so I have to figure out which ones you couldn't and it came down to seven but the list is open to amendment, and in fact, has been changed, uh, by now, ha, a lot of people pointed things out to me, and I noticed some myself. (laughter) you know that? (laughter) Fuck. (laughter) Fuck you and everybody that looks like you. (laughter) man. (laughter) The other shit one was, I don't give a shit. (laughter) If I give a shit, I would have to pack shit. (laughter) You wouldn't shit me, would you? You wouldn't shit me, would you? (laughter) Twat is an interesting word because it's the only one IO know of, the only slang word applying to the, a part of the sexual anatomy that doesn't have another meaning to it. The Court today reviews only the Commission's holding that Carlin's monologue was indecent \"as broadcast\" at two o'clock in the afternoon, and not the broad sweep of the Commission's opinion.... I also agree with much that is said in Part IV of Mr. Justice Stevens' opinion, and with its conclusion that the Commission's holding in this case does not violate the First Amendment. It is argued that despite society's right to protect its children from this kind of speech, and despite everyone's interest in not being assaulted by offensive speech in the home, the Commission's holding in this case is impermissible because it prevents willing adults from listening to Carlin's monologue over the radio in the early afternoon hours. The Commission's holding, and certainly the Court's holding today, does not speak to cases involving the isolated use of a potentially offensive word in the course of a radio broadcast, as distinguished from the verbal shock treatment administered by respondent here. I agree with Mr. Justice Stewart that, under Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87 (1974) [other citations omitted], the word \"indecent\" in 18 USC section 1464 must be construed to prohibit only obscene speech. Yet, despite the Court's refusal to create a sliding scale of First Amendment protection calibrated to this Court's perception of the worth of a communiation['s content, and despite our unanimous agreement that the Carlin monologue is protected speech, a majority of the Court nevertheless finds that, on the facts of this case, the FCC is not constitutionally barred from imposing sanctions on Pacifica for its airing of the Carlin monologue.",
