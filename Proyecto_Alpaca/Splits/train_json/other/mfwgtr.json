PLD Programming Below is an ABEL file describing a simple 3-bit up-counter (upcount3.abl in the class directory). Program a PLD (instructions furnished at beginning of class) to implement this function and use your clock generator to provide a clock input. Use switches to provide the other inputs to the PLD and LEDs to observe the outputs. CLK\t\tpin 1;\t\t\t\t\"Clock\" Q0,Q1,Q2\tpin 12,13,14 istype 'reg';\t\"Counter Outputs\" En\t\tpin 2;\t\t\t\t\"Counter Enable Signal\" Reset\t\tpin 3;\t\t\t\t\"Counter Reset Signal\" WHEN (Reset) THEN Output := 0; ELSE WHEN (!En) THEN Output := Output; test_vectors ([CLK,Reset,En] -> Output) [.C., 1 ,.X.] This tells Synario to create a JED file for the PLD programmer that programs the 20 pin PLD provided in your lab kit. Now you should be able to save your new ABEL file and return to the main Synario environment. Use switches and LEDs for the inputs and outputs and your debounced push-button switch to provide a clock signal (that you can single-step by pushing on the switch). Constructing Your Circuit You will need some PLDs, a keypad, an LCD screen, and a potentiometer for its constrast control, Schmidt triggers ('14) and resistors and capacitors for switch debouncing. The clock will be provided by your pulse generator (remember that your pulser output is open-collector, so you will need a pull-up resistor, 1KOhm should work fine). (If you have a 3-column keypad, then there are only 3 column wires and 8 wires total.) When a key is pressed the corresponding column and row wires are connected to the common signal (see the figure below). Therefore, the keypad is called a 2-of-8, 2 of the 8 wires will be active low when a key is pressed, the others are pulled high through resistor connections to 5v. To debounce the type of switch in the keypad (single-pole single-throw or SPST) will require a special analog circuit consisting of a resistor, capacitor, and a Schmitt trigger (`LS14). Test your keypad with your logic probe. If the time constant is longer than the bounce time then there won't be enough time to charge the capacitor enough to trip the Schmitt trigger and the output will stay high. Once the switch is let go, there will be enough time and the capacitor will eventually charge to 5v and the output of the Schmitt triggers will be low. There is also an excellent FAQ describing your LCD module. ABEL program listing, test results, equations and PLD pinout.",
