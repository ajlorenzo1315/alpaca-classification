Timing consists of a person or group of people listening to the soundtrack and marking the starting and ending times of sentences. These times are then used by a computer along with a translation to overlay text on the film. There are a couple methods of timing. One method is to listen to the soundtrack and whenever one hears the start of a sentence, he presses a key to mark the time on a computer (known as spacebar method). This method is common among hobbyists due to minimal equipment requirements. It has drawbacks though. It can be a fairly accurate method of timing, but only with a large amount of practice. However, it has an advantage in that the skill requirement is lower, the end accuracy is higher, and the method is highly parallel. Because the information is stored digitally, it can be divided among multiple people. With the second method, the amount of sound a person needs to listen to is less than a second. I theorize that all the data the human needs to make this decision is present in the data stream. Thus it should be possible for a computer to simulate the decision making by analyzing the same data. Project The goal of this project is to determine how accurately a neural net can simulate a human in recognizing the start of speech. As a means of comparison, Id also analyze the accuracy of a dumb algorithm. This method is to measure relative difference in intensity between sound segments with the start of a word being marked when the intensity goes over a threshold. This is classically fooled by loud sound effects and background music. It can also be fooled depending if a sentence begins with a hard or soft consonant. I hypothesize that a neural net should be able to account for these two problems. [ Back to top ] Maintained by Jerry Hsu - jh32@cornell.edu",
