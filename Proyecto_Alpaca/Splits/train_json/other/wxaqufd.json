    "Cuerpo": "Hyperproof Hyperproof is a system for learning the principles of analytical reasoning and proof construction, consisting of a text and a Macintosh software program. Hyperproof is compatible with various natural-deduction-style proof systems, including the system used in the authors' The Language of First-order Logic. \" With it you can construct and check proofs in an expanded version of the language of Tarski's World . Since it presupposes familiarity with the program Tarski's World , it should be used in tandem with either the textbook The Language of First-order Logic or the stand-alone version of Tarski's World ( Tarski \"Lite\" ). Ordering information Show me Hyperproof [ Top | Hyperproof Table of Contents | Information for current users | Acknowledgements ] The Language of First-order Logic (Mac or PC) The Language of First-order Logic presents a new approach to teaching first-order logic. Part IV contains advanced topics in logic, including topics of importance in applications of logic in computer science. The Language of First-order Logic contains hundreds of problems and exercises. \"[ The Language of First-order Logic ] is packed with interesting exercises and problems which make imaginative use of [ Tarski's World ]. This is an excellent package and we recommend it highly as the basis of either a complete first course in logic or as an initial part of such a course.\" Since Hyperproof uses an extension of the natural-deduction-style proof system taught in The Language of First-order Logic , it can be used to accompany this text. The Language of First-order Logic is available in versions for Macintosh and Microsoft Windows. Tarski's World allows the students to build three-dimensional worlds and to describe them in first-order logic. Tarski's World is available in two ways, either alone (called Tarski's World 4.0 or Tarski \"Lite\" ) or as part of the logic textbook/software package called The Language of First-order Logic . Tarski \"Lite\" , the stand-alone package, is intended as a supplement to any standard logic text or for use by anyone who wants to learn the language. [ Tarski's World ] is the only program that I know for teaching first-order semantics, and it sets a high standard. --Wilfrid Hodges, Queen Mary College Tarski \"Lite\" is available for Macintosh or Microsoft Windows.
