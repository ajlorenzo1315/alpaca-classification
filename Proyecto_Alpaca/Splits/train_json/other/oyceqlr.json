    "Cuerpo": "The projects will be either on PREDATOR or on MINIBASE. If you want me to put you in a group with someone else, I can do that. The main research purpose of the system is to explore techniques to support a large number of data types in an extensible manner (meaning that it should be possible to extend the system to support fields of a new type -- like video, or image --- without changing the system significantly. Most of the course projects will either involve extending and enhancing the SQL functionality, or it will involve adding support for a new data type. Work will involve finding out about OPT++, integrating it with PREDATOR query evaluation, and demonstrating query optimization on simple join queries. (2 persons) The purpose of this project is to build a graphical tool that displays a query plan (the result of query optimization), and also displays the execution of that plan (possibly by displaying how the computation is proceeding). (2 persons) This project involves getting a good understanding of the way indexes are used in query processing. This project will involve a balance of adding some functionality (so that some of the benchmark queries run), and improving the performance of those queries. Implement an image data type (RIVL) (2 persons) PREDATOR already has a very elementary image data type. Implement an image data type (Vision) (2 persons) PREDATOR already has a very elementary image data type. Implement a video data type (1 or 2 persons) Add a video data type with support for the various operations defined in RIVL (Brian Smith's multi-media system) Implement an audio data type (1 or 2 persons) This requires some knowledge of audio data, and the likely operations on audio. Implement a text document data type (1 or 2 persons) Add a document data type, along with NLP operations on the document (based on Claire Cardie's work). This project will try to support a molecule structure as a data type in the database. This project will build a C++ embedding of PREDATOR SQL. If 2 persons work on this, some query transformations will also be required in this project. The idea is that there is information or patterns hidden in a database that are not very evident. The purpose of the project is to implement some of the algorithms suggested in the literature, and see how they perform. Implement data clustering algorithms (2 persons) This is another aspect of data mining (see above). Build standalone System-R optimizer and randomized optimizer (2 persons) Query optimization is (and has been) a very important topic in database query processing. Since you will not have a lot of help on Visual C++ from me or the TA, you should already be familiar with this environment if you plan to take on this project.",
