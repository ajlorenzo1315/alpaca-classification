Discussion 7: Week of Oct. 21 Data structure: Queue (implemented as fixed-sized array) Program files (includes a program to test the queue). Photocopies of transparencies from the lecture are available outside Rob's office. Discussion 8: Week of Oct. 28 Data structure: Queue (implemented as linked list) Program files (includes a program to test the queue). Photocopies of transparencies from the lecture are available outside Rob's office. Lab Homework Solutions: QueueDelete FreeQueue Discussion 9: Week of Nov. 4 MergeSort (Recursive Version): sorting using the Merge operation. Merge and MergeSort code (in a test program). Photocopies of transparencies from the lecture are available outside Rob's office. Discussion 10: Week of Nov. 11 Tree to store Hierarchical Information and Traversing Breadth-First Tree Interface : what we need to know to use a tree. Queue Interface : what we need to know to use a queue. Photocopies of transparencies from the lecture are available outside Rob's office. Discussion 11: Week of Nov. 18 Expression Trees : used to store arithmetic expressions using a recursive model of an expression. Depth-first traversal function that evaluates an expression. Photocopies of transparencies from the lecture are available outside Rob's office. Each of the 2 discussions will cover roughly the same material as the other. If you cannot make the discussion that you are assigned to, feel free to come to the other one; however, the number of computers in the lab are limited. Rob's Hours Day Time Room Mon 1-2pm UNIX lab (B24) Mon 2-4pm MCS-223 Tue 6-7pm UNIX lab (B24) Wed 10-11am UNIX lab (B24) When I am in the UNIX lab, I am there to assist all 100-level computer science course students and help will be available on a first-come-first-serve basis.
