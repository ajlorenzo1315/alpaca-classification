    "Cuerpo": "In this game, you try to guess a \"secret\" word or phrase one letter at a time. Add the files for the string class and the functions to your project. You can now use this program as a \"shell\" or \"template\" for the hangman program. Note: The next time you run Borland C++ in order to work on Program 3, you will need to a \"Project/Open\", not a \"File/Open.\" (Note that these files are source files ending in \".cpp\" and \".h\" instead of object files ending in \".obj\" - that's ok.) Then, when creating the project, eliminate the prefix \"r:\\public\\mbirk\" and replace all of the \".obj\" suffixes with \".cpp\". For example: string first_name = \"John\"; string last_name  = \"Doe\"; cout << \"Hello, \" << first_name << \" \" << last_name << \"!\\n\"; In addition, you can \"add\" two strings together with the + operator. For this you need to know how long the string is; use the length member function for this. Also, note that you can modifiy the characters of a string using the brackets. These functions are the following: string random_secret_phrase (); Returns a string that is a\"random\" secret phrase to use in the hangman game. Note: don't forget to have your program print your name and section number, so that they show up on all of your printouts! You have five chances to guess the secret phrase. Enter a letter: t Sorry, that letter is not in the secret phrase. Enter a letter: R Sorry, that letter is not in the secret phrase. Enter a letter: s Sorry, that letter is not in the secret phrase. Enter a letter: p Sorry, that letter is not in the secret phrase. Enter a letter: l Sorry, that letter is not in the secret phrase. You have five chances to guess the secret phrase. Enter a letter: e Sorry, that letter is not in the secret phrase. Enter a letter: # That is not a letter. Enter a letter: l Sorry, that letter is not in the secret phrase.",
