She transfered to Washington my senior year. Right now she's working at Weyerhauser. Scott DeWinter Scott was the other froshling. He's involved with this woman who was, for at least a short time, convinced I was roughly equivalent to Satan (I hope that situation has improved a little). He wants to buy a Jeep, but I beat him to it. David Perlman David is in graduate school at the University of Washington, but probably not for long. Like Todd, the bordom bug has hit him hard. He doesn't have an excuse, though, because he has a relatively steady LTR. David is a nice, caring person. He's a strange person, but I've been hanging around with strange people so long that normal people make me sick. That's not to say that strange people don't make me sick, of course. Tony, coincidentally, also eats worms. Rob Pfile Rob was one of my housemates from last year, although he was out at Sun for most of that time. Sarah Seastone This is my mother. Since I left for college, she has gone back to her maiden name, her area code has changed, and she has moved. Erich Schneider Erich was a senior at Caltech when I was a freshman, and I spent much of freshman and sophomore year hanging out with him. He gets along with his parents really well, which he attributes to the fact he hasn't spent much time with them. He has to beat the women off with a stick.",
