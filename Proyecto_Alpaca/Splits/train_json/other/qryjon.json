I plan to do my generals and my thesis in this area, and hope to graduate around the time our new building is completed (or soon after). Other Interests In addition to phased compilation, lately I've been interested in extensible operating systems and distributed systems . This past spring, I read up on techniques for creating and exploiting instruction-level parallelism (ILP) . Many of the papers came from the IMPACT group at UIUC . Collective Communication In spring 1995, I finished my quals project under Richard Ladner , Design and Analysis of Collective-Communication Primitives . I have a few more ideas that I'm exploring in this area and I should have a paper available later this year. GAPP In my second year, I also did a cool project with Eric Anderson for the distributed and parallel systems course . It was a good idea, but its performance suffered a little due to a massive, sparse switch statement that was converted to a series of tests and branches by the compiler. Actually, dynamic compilation would have been ideal for this application. We also had some other ideas for optimizing the computation of which packet processors should execute on a given packet, but development on SPIN's networking framework was beginning by the end of the quarter, so we didn't bother to pursue it further. Teaching During my first year at UW, when my office was in Sieg, I was a teaching assistant, first for CSE/ENGR-142 , the first-semester programming course (when it was in Ada), then for CSE-451 , the undergraduate operating systems course. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory I spent three summers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory . During the next two summers, while working on my main project, a parallel climate model, I looked into MPI , even attending one of the MPI Forums in Dallas. I gave a tutorial on MPI at LLNL, and later another at Boeing Computing Services. The transportability of the code was deemed to be crucial, as this would allow the group to take advantage of the latest, most powerful multicomputers available. My senior year I was president of the Purdue Student Chapter of the ACM . Additionally, I helped to resurrect the defunct math club by serving as its treasurer, then vice president, and by helping to make it a student chapter of the Mathematical Association of America .",
