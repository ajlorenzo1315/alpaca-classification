Determine the speed of a motor shaft using an optical sensor, Integrate the two systems so that a motor can be run at a predetermined speed under a variety of loading conditions. Part 1: Setting Up the Motors and Optical Speed Sensors You will need to fabricate a disk with black and white strips to be used in conjunction with the optical sensors to determine the speed at which the motor shaft is spinning. Cut out the one with 16 black stripes and paste it (using a glue stick) to a piece of foam board. Cut out the combination. Punch a hole in the center using the sharp end of a pair of scissors (be careful not to cut yourself) so that the disk pressure fits onto the pully shaft of the motor. You will also need to attach the motor and the sensor together. Scotch tape works well for this. No more than 20 mA should be allowed to flow through the LED. With a 5 volt supply, an 180 ohm series resistor works well. On the receiving end, a 6.8 kiloohm series resistor will make an excellent voltage divider converting the current change caused to the presense or absense of a reflecting surface into a voltage change interpretable at CMOS digital levels. To determine how close the sensor has to be to a reflecting surface, measure the voltage changes between the resistor/phototransistor connection and ground as the distance between the sensor and the surface varies. I found that the sensor had to be be about 1/20 of a inch from the surface. Your sensor and circuit might be slightly different. Please note the unusual pinout. There are four output buffers on this chip, so there is enough circuitry for 2 H-Bridges. Part 2: Connecting the Speed Sensors to the Motors Using Feedback Since the speed of a motor depends not only on the applied voltage but also on the amount of load, feedback from speed sensors is necessary to accurately control the speed of your motor. Your are to devise a system to control the speed of your motors using the optical speed sensors as input and a variation in duty-cycle as output. More on this later. Part 3: Operate Two Motors Simultaneously Modify your microcontroller program to control two motors simultaneously.",
