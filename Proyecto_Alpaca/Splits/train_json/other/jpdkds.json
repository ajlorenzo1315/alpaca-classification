Failure to do so is called cheating and results in loss of one's scientific standing (and worse). This also applies to homework handed in under one's own name. Specifically, the instructor has nothing against students cooperating on homework assignments provided such cooperation is explicitly acknowledged in the homework handed in and provided the students understand that mere copying without understanding can only hurt in the exam (not to mention the fact that it defeats the course's basic goal which is for the students to learn the course material). assignments If you pick up the TeX file of an assignment, be aware of certain peculiarities: Material between vertical bars within the text is meant to appear in print in typewriter font, like a matlab expression. assignment 1 ( in TeX ), due 10sep96 . assignment 2 ( in TeX ), due 24sep96 .

Any homework not handed in by 5p of the due date loses 25%. To `hand in' homework outside class, put it into the instructor's mailbox (fifth floor of CS & Stat) or hand it directly to the instructor (if you can find him :-).",
