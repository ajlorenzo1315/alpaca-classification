Since you asked. Photo credit: Doug Kalemba Well, I was born in Bethel Park, PA, a large, middle-class suburb of Pittsburgh. Forget the fish-filled lake where ducks waddle across on the backs of their finny friends. This is a region, after all, where you can travel from Moon to Mars in less than half an hour, eat sandwiches stuffed with french fries and watch grown men consult a rodent about the weather. \"I think we have a very high intrinsic oddness quotient,\" said Denny Bonavita, managing editor of the Courier-Express in DuBois, about 80 miles northeast of Pittsburgh. We're backward.\" Once very common, the \"Pittsburgh left\" is now only sporadically practiced, which makes it even more confusing for newcomers. He moved to Pittsburgh from Chicago in 1993. Drivers also drive at or below the speed limit and frequently let others cut in -- a bit disconcerting for outsiders, particularly those from less well-mannered regions. \"No one ever honks at you in Pittsburgh or flips the finger at you,\" said a disbelieving Dawn Keezer, director of the Pittsburgh Film Office and a recent transplant from Santa Cruz, Calif.

A chipmunk is a \"grinny,\" a sparrow is a \"sputzie\" and to clean is to \"redd up,\" as in, \"Please redd up the table.\" \"It's intriguing and different in the sense that you do have words which seem to have no basis in what they describe,\" said Ken Abel, co-author of \"The Tongue-In-Cheek Guide To Pittsburgh.\" But in an area where the first day of deer hunting is a school holiday, it's not surprising that animals are frequently the objects of violence. As for the source of the region's peculiarities, some speculate it's a function of geography. Mountainous and heavily rural, western Pennsylvania is mostly made up of small communities that sprang up in river valleys and often remained -- and remain -- relatively isolated.",
