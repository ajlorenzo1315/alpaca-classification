    "Cuerpo": "Assignments for CS 100A are due on Tuesdays (Exception: Because there is only one week of classes between Thanksgiving break and the end of classes for the semester, the final program will be due on a Thursday.) CS 100A Program Due at 4:00 pm on 1 Tue., Sept. 10 2 Tue., Sept. 26 3 Tue., Oct. 8 4 Tue., Oct. 29 5 Tue., Nov. 12 6 Thurs., Dec. 5 Programs are due at 4:00 pm on the day assigned. No Late Assignments Will Be Accepted . Programs may be handed in by giving them to a consultant in the Carpenter Lab. Programs may also be handed in at the end of lecture on the assigned date. The first comment in each program must contain your name and Cornell ID#, the day and time you attend section, and your section instructor's name. Each program will be given two grades - one for correctness and one for program organization and style. Working with Partners: For the programming assignments, you may work with one other student - we encourage you to do this. If you work with a partner, you should normally submit only one programming assignment between the two of you. The program must contain both of your names and ID#'s and information about when you attend sections in the first comment at the beginning of the program. The program will be returned in section to the first person named in the comment; the other person will receive for their records a cover sheet showing the assigned grade. Both of you must sign your names on the first page of the program. Working with a partner can be very helpful both in getting the assignments to work and in clarifying your understanding of the course material. But be sure that both you and your partner share in the work equally, and that both of you understand it. You cannot take the exams with a partner. Review sessions are scheduled on Sunday Sept. 29, Oct. 20, Nov. 17, and Dec. 15 in Olin 155 Graded Assignments and Exams: Will be returned in your section. Regrades: If you feel an exam or program has been incorrectly graded, fill out a regrade request giving your reasons in writing, attach the exam or program to it and give it to a consultant in the Carpenter lab. A regrade request can cause your grade to go up or down - the paper will be regraded from scratch. If you find an error, please contact the course administrator, Laurie Buck, during her office hours . Course Grades: Grades for CS100A are computed as follows: Final Grades Programs - 20% Prelim 1 - 10% Prelim 2 - 20% Prelim 3 -  20% Final -  30% Your letter grade will be based on your total score.",
