    "Cuerpo": "A dynamic brittle-ductile transition in a simulation of 100 million atoms. A simulation of the dynamical failure of 3D notched solids under tension at the atomistic level using classical molecular dynamics and system sizes from 10 to more than 100 million atoms. (Research by Farid Abraham, IBM Almaden Research Center, Visualization by Bruce Land and David Schneider.) Diagnosis of Emphysema and Lung Cancer using 3D techniques. Modern radiologic techniques, particularly computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, acquire more data than are routinely displayed in diagnostic images. Supercomputers can be very helpful in processing and presenting this information. Image analysis used on appropriate images in conjunction with representative patient databases will permit the development of clinical analysis and decision support systems and will form an integral part of the diagnostic process in the future.

SORTIE Simulation: A Model of Forest Growth A simulation of 1000 years of forest growth under different conditions. (Research by Douglas Deutschman and Linda Buttel at Cornell and Simon Levin at Princeton University, Visualization by Catherine Devine.) That is, one cannot \"hear the shape of a drum.\" (Research by Toby Driscoll, Center for Applied Math, Cornell. Visualization by Bruce Land.) Cornell/Honeywell Keyboard Systems Study Two-dimension angular deviation data of wrist motion, obtained with an exoskeleton measuring glove worn by human subjects using keyboards, had previously been obtained by Hedge. While human factors researchers had long used such measuring devices to obtain wrist motion data, this data had not previously been visualized. Tsunami simulations Tusnami are caused by underwater earthquakes which start waves propagating rapidly across the ocean. Simulations help to understand and predict these large, often dangerous, phenomena.
