In this lab you will investigate implicit surface generation. That is, by placing polygons in all of the voxels which have scalar data of a certain value. Note the programs in this exercise will not run without these macros. InitCSGmacro.net MakeCSGsurfacemacro.net UnionCSGmacro.net blobbyMacro.net The program heart.net takes as input an implicit function of x,y,z and forms an surface. As an example, the following image was made by defining an implicit sphere in a separate module from the heart, then morphing between them by linearly intropolating between the two 3D fields. In this case, mixing .9 of the heart 3D field with 0.1 of the sphere 3D field. The two cylinder surfaces are combined (in the UnionCSG macro) using a min(a,b) function so that the voxels which are in the interior of either cylinder are interior to the result. (Remember that an implicit function changes sign as the surface is crossed and that for the surfaces used here, that points inside have a negative value.) The image below is the result of the union of two cylinders. See one of last year's student projects for more information on blobby functions. An example from blobby.net shows four positive spheres (transparent red) and two negative spheres (blue) which when summed together, then passed thorough an isosurface module produce the object shown to the right. You will need to construct a function which is negative if the position (x,y,z) is within a certain distance of a circle and positive otherwise. Include interactors to set the radius of the torus and the radius of its cross-section. Provide interactors for performing a union, intersection, or subtraction of the two selected shapes. That is, your program should be able to, for example, select a sphere and a cone, and form the subtraction of cone-minus-sphere or sphere-minus-cone or union the sphere and the cone or intersect the sphere and the cone. Shown below are the intersection of two cylinders and one cylinder \"minus\" the other. You will need to modify blobby.macro.net to output a 3D field rather than a surface. You should be able to explain your programs. You should use transmitters/receivers, macros, and comments in the \"Notation\" field of each module so that you and the grader can understand the program.",
