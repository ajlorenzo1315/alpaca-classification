This fall, CS838 is a graduate seminar that will examine Java, including the Java programming language, network security, design of distributed applets, Java virtual machines, and Java implementations (compilers, interpreters, and special hardware). Other Java-related topics are both welcome and encouraged. This course will be taugh as a research seminar. Students will be evaluated on the oral and written presentation of their project. This offering of CS 838 is NOT a core CS course. Most of these books were written very quickly and are very superficial. The Addison-Wesley series is the \"official\" Sun reference books on Java and are much better than the average (but see below; many of them are on-line). The Virtual Machine Specification The Java API (Application Programmer Interface, i.e., libraries) Specification Java Language Tutorial Security-related papers: Dean, Felten, Wallach, \"Java Security: From HotJava to Netscape and Beyond. Frank Yellin, \"Low Level Security in Java. JavaSoft, Frequently Asked Questions - Applet Security. The web also can provide a Java Development Kit for writing and running Java applications on a PC. The department also has the source to the JDK. Sun has a collection at: http://java.sun.com/java.sun.com/applets/index.html (that's not a typo!). The largest collection of Java programs and applets appears to be at http://www.gamelan.com . Lecture Slides Postscript of our lecture transparancies are available: Java Big Picture Java Language Overview Java Virtual Machine Implementing the Java VM in Hardware? Interpreted Java Applets An Evaluation of Alternative Implementations of Java Monitors A Comparison of the Java Virtual Machine with Xerox Mesa Bytecodes The Microarchitecture of a Processor that Directly Executes Java Bytecodes Optimizing Java Compiler Rationalizing the Java Library Performance Evaluation Tools and Results for Java Programs Evaluation of Java Security Investigate compiling other languages to the Java VM. Investigate was of formalizing the security requirements of a language and system and ways of automatically generating/verifying VM implementations. In particular, is Java's static typing sufficient to alleviate the overheads?
