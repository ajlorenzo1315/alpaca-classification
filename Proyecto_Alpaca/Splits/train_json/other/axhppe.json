He has also participated in advanced processor research efforts at Stanford University . So if you intend to turn in this homework and have not yet done so, you must turn it in latest by May 1. Midterm weight will be added to the final exam. 4. load any .s file in the directory ../Tests 5. if you like you can add /slinky.b/csphd/fangzhe/spim/bin in your PATH environment variable 6. You can also read appendix A of the textbook. Note-2: Please note that a good on-time homework record can boost your final grade, if you are on the fence. Note-3: Homeworks may be emailed to the TA (fangzhe@cs.nyu.edu).

Assigned Homeworks Homework-5: Due: Apr 25 (points same as in Text) 5.1 - 5.16 (You can use Fig. 6.25 to 6.29. Homework-4: Due: Apr 4 (points same as in Text or shown in large brackets) 4.1 - 4.19 4.26 - 4.30 4.39, 4.41, 4.42 Using the algorithm in Fig. 4.43, carry out the following multiplication in binary: -0.625 x 1.4375. [10] Homework-3: Due: Mar 21 (points shown in large brackets) Text B.7 [15] Text B.8 [15] Text B.12 [15] Consider the following gate called IMPLICATION gate which implements the following function: C = A -> B : A=F, B=F => C=T A=F, B=T => C=T A=T, B=F => C=F A=T, B=T => C=T a) Can you build an invertor using this gate? Note-2: The redundant term \"YZ\" or \"(Y + Z)\" are also called 'consensus' Note-3: Earlier (prior to Mar 18) part 2 had a typo. Use the consensus theorems to prove the following: [15] ABCD + B'CDE + A'B' + BCE' = A'B' + BCE' + ACDE Use the consensus theorem to prove the following addition theorem: [10] (X + Y) (X' + Z) = XZ + X'Y Use the theorems above to show: [20] (A + B + C') (A + D' + E) (A + B + D) (A' + C) = AC + A'BD' + A'BE + A'C'DE Show the PLA implementation (similar to Figs. You cannot shift right starting as least-significant-bit position!
