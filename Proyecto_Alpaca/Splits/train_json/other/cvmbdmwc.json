Seafood is a very good bet. There are a large number of Thai restaurants which are consistently good, and a smattering of Vietnamese restaurants. There are a number of good Japanese restaurants. In addition to being a good place to eat, Seattle is also a good place to drink: there are several microbreweries that make very good beers, and Northwest wines are gaining increasing recognition. Many of the restaurants are within walking distance from Downtown hotels (especially the Downtown, Pike Place Market, and some of the Capitol Hill restaurants). The restaurants listed for Pioneer Square, the International District, Seattle Center, and the eastern reaches of Captiol Hill are further away but still within walking distance; you can also, of course, take the bus (the new downtown bus tunnel is worth a visit in any case) or a cab. Restaurants are classified as inexpensive, inexpensive-moderate, moderate, moderate-expensive, and expensive.
