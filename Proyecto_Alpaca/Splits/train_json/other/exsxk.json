    "Cuerpo": "Please read and understand the following excerpts from a longer version of the Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity. Violations of the Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity occurring in Computer Science courses are taken very seriously. The following are excerpts from a longer version of the Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity. The exclusion of any part does not excuse ignorance of the code. Principle Absolute integrity is expected of every Cornell student in all academic undertakings. He/she must in no way misrepresent his/her work fraudulently or unfairly advance his/her academic status, or be a party to another student's failure to maintain academic integrity. The maintenance of an atmosphere of academic honor and the fulfillment of the provisions of this Code are the responsibilities of the students and faculty of Cornell. Definition of Academic Integrity A student assumes responsibility for the content and integrity of the academic work he/she submits, such as papers, examinations, or reports. A student is guilty of violating the Code, and subject to proceedings under it, if he/she: knowingly represents the work of others as his/her own uses or obtains unauthorized assistance in any academic work gives fraudulent assistance to another student fabricates data in support of laboratory or field work forges a signature to certify completion or approval of a course assignment in any other manner violates the principle of absolute integrity. You may discuss work with other students, and give or receive \"consulting\" help from other students, but such permissible cooperation should never involve one student having in his or her possession a copy of all or part of another student's assignment, regardless of whether that copy is on paper, on a computer disk, or in a computer file. It is your responsibility to protect your work from unauthorized access. This applies to both handwritten and programming assignments. Penalties The penalty for any violation of this Code in Computer Science courses will be determined by the instructor according to accepted procedures. They are not private accounts; they belong to the Department of Computer Science and the use of these accounts may be monitored in various ways.
