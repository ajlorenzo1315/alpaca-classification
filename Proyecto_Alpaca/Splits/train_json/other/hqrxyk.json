When the program is started, a window is created with a command menu and input and output areas. Use the command Output Language to select the desired language for the program that is created. (The actual program will be served to you in a file that is presented after the demo program is terminated.) Use the input lines to specify the name and type of each input variable, one per line, in the format shown. Examples are (radius integer) and (speed (units real mph)) . Then select the command New Program to start VIP. A VIP program is created by connecting diagram boxes that represent variables and physical and mathematical principles. To make a connection, click the mouse, once for each end of the connection, on variable boxes or on \"buttons\" associated with diagrams. To get a useful program, there must be a connection to the OUTPUT box. The VIP commands are as follows: Done Finished; make a program from the diagram. Click the box you wish to move. Physics Select a new physical principle box. Make Var Make a local variable. Specify Type Specify the type of a variable. OP Make an operation box, such as + - * / . Type-in Type in a numeric constant, with units if desired. Instructions You must be logged in to a host running X windows. For example, myterminal.cs.utexas.edu:0.0 Click to start the demo. Gordon S.
