    "Cuerpo": "Part 1: Powering up the EVB and connecting it to the PC You will need to supply power to the evaluation board through the power supply connected to your protoboard. Four lines are needed: +12, -12, +5, and GND. The supply lines are clearly marked on the power supply name plate and the EVB. You will be responsible for this sort of damage.) The serial line from the PC should be connected to the terminal port on the EVB (the RS-232 connector furthest away from the red reset button.) You will need to configure the baud rate to be 9600 (under the Settings->Communications panel). The \"Delay Between Lines\" value should be set to \"1/10\" of a second. Now plug in the power supply, and press the red reset button on the EVB. A prompt should be sent to the terminal program and displayed on the PC's screen. It should read: BUFFALO 2.5 (ext) - Bit User Fast Friendly Aid to Logical Operation Pressing return twice should list a bunch on commands that the EVB and BUFFALO can be asked to perform. Then issue the commands lists on page 4-29. Part 3: Assembly Language Program Devise an assembly language program to turn a port bit on and off with a cycle period of one second. To get started, download the following sample program to the EVB. STAA $1004 Type this program in using \"notepad\" and run the assembler that is located at \"T:\\cse477\\buffalo\\as11.exe\". Run the assembler using the file manager's RUN command and the assembly program's name as its only argument. To load the assembled file to the EVB, you need to perform a text Transfer using the terminal emulator. First type LOAD T at the BUFFALO prompt and then pull down the Transfers->Send Text File panel. Your program should now be loaded into the EVB. (I don't know why you need to do this.) What to Turn In Turn in the assembly program that makes the port bit turn on and off with a cycle period of one second.",
