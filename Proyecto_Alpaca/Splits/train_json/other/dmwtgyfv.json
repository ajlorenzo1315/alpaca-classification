Your program will answer the following questions for each number entered by the user. So, for example, if 8 is entered as the starting place, then the answer to question #1 is 4 (i.e., including the initial input, the fourth number in the sequence 8 4 2 1 is 1 ). Program Design Hints Your main program should work as follows: It should prompt the user to enter a number ( 0 to quit) between  1 and 150. If the user enters a number outside this range, the program MUST INDICATE AN ERROR AND PROMPT THE USER AGAIN FOR ANOTHER VALUE IN THE CORRECT RANGE. If the user enters a valid number your program must display the hailstone series, the length of the series, the maximum value attained within the series and the mean value of all elements in the series. Then it must prompt the user for the next number. This process must go on until the user enters a '0' indicating that s/he would like to quit. As long as the user enters numbers in the valid range (1 to 150), the program must print the the hailstones series, the length of series, the maximum value attained in the series and the mean value of all elements in the series. You will probably find it useful to define a function that computes the series, the length of the series and the mean value of the elements in the series. You will receive almost no credit if you do not use functions. You might find it helpful to  write a function that actually takes in a number as input  and returns and the hailstone series in an array along with the length of the series (hint : Look at the function prototype for the function generateHailstoneSeries(...) in the skeleton below). Your test cases You will be required to turn in the screen output generated from a program run in which the user looks at the Hailstone Series of at least three numbers (from 1 to 150). If I do not receive an electronic copy of your source code and executable, you will lose numerous points. A printed copy of your program run Items 2 and 3 must be stapled together.
