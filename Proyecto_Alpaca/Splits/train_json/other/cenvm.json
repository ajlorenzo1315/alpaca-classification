Programming projects are written in the programming language C.  Some assignments will also use Matlab. The course may be taken for a letter grade or, if your college or program advisor allows it, S/U General Information CS 100A Instructors: Tim Teitelbaum - Upson 4143, 255-7573 Mike Godrey - Upson 308, 255-1051 Office Hours: 3-4pm Tu&Th Hal Perkins - Upson 322, 255-2352 Office Hours: 1-2pm M&Th Todd Wilson - Upson 5146, 255-1543 Office Hours: Tu 10-11am, F 2:30-3:30 Teaching Assistants: All ocnsulting hours in Upson 339 Andrew Chew - Upson 329, 255-???

If you need to cancel an appointment, you must call the Undergraduate Office in advance. Lectures: Lectures for CS100A and CS100B meet at the same times. Lecture section numbers, times and rooms are as follows: Lectures CS 100A 1 TR 9:05 Olin 155 2 TR 11:15 Olin 155 Sections: CS 100A Sections # Day Time Room 1 Tue. Sections are a required part of the course used to clarify topics covered in lecture, discuss programming problems, and work additional problems and exercises. However, there will be some variations in problems and exercises depending on the instructor and the interests of the students in each section. The computer room in the basement of Carpenter Hall is the primary lab for CS 100. CS 100 students have priority in this lab, and this is where you will find CS 100 consultants, extra copies of handouts, unclaimed work, and posted announcements and grades. Although Carpenter is the primary lab for CS 100, CodeWarrior is available on all of CIT's public Macintoshes that have enough disk space and RAM to support it. (Bring you ID card with you when you pick up an exam) Receive regrade requests Provide tutoring, but only during slack periods. Exams in CS 100 are not based on the reading list; they are based on material covered in lectures, sections, and assignments. You are not \"responsible\" for material in the book that is not covered in class. Communications: Announcements are posted on the bulletin board to your right as you enter the Carpenter lab and are on the newsgroups cornell.class.cs100a Software: Cornell Information Technologies (CIT) provides Metrowerks CodeWarrior and Matlab on all of its public Macintosh computers. To access Matlab, you will be given a user name and password (all students in CS 100 use the same user name and password). If you forget it, you will have to see your instructor.",
