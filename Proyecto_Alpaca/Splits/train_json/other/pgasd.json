    "Cuerpo": "Scientific visualization is a term which refers to the process of converting data into pictures. The techniques will be used to view a simulated landscape, complete with rivers and clouds. The gradient vectorfield and the streamlines are shown also. Procedure: You will need to download the program Landscape.net Landscape.cfg The program caluclates a 2D field of altitudes to make a landscape. It also calculates a 3D scalar field of densities to use as a cloud. Refine module which interpolates points into a field. Map module which allows the data in one field to be interpolated onto the positions of another field. Modify the program to add the following features: Modify the colors of the rivers by mapping the magnitude of the gradient (the slope) onto the streamlines, then coloring them so that high slopes regions of the streams are white to simulate rapids, while lower slopes are blue. The program as given uses a Map module to map altitude to the streamlines. Modify the river generator to start rivers at regular grid points (say 5 by 5) on the surface. Use the Construct module to make a starting grid. See the image above with 100 stream starts for an example. Modify the program to produce \"trees\" on the surface. If the \"type\" input of the Glyph module is given a geometry (say a cone) it will place it at every point on the surface. If you use a parametric surface as an input be sure to run it through a Refine module with the \"level\" input set to \"triangles\". Use an Include module to limit the trees to a band of elevations, as shown below. You will probably want to use a Reduce module to lower the density of trees on the surface. Modify the program to produce an animation of the cloud. The animation should show the cloud changing from one density distribution to another by interplolating between two fixed density functions. The cloud animation may be in a separate program.",
