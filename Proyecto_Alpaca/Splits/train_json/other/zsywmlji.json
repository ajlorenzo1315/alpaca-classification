    "Cuerpo": "Texts Operating System Concepts (4th Edition) by Silberschatz and Galvin Also known as the dinosaur book. Currently available in the bookstore. You might also want to pick up a book on C that suits your tastes. I will try to make several copies of the main textbook available for loan in the engineering library. If you do not, see the CSE main office for a form. Computer Software You'll need to know how to use several pieces of software in this class. mail, grep, ls, etc. The Web You already know enough about the web to have gotten to this point. Everyone in this class should set up their own home page if they haven't done so already. You'll need to know how to use tools like the C compiler, make, and a debugger (either dbx or gdb) in order to do the programming assignment. You're be on your own for using these tools; we'll not be spending any time in lecture on them. I don't know. If you don't currently have an entry code, you should file a petition for entry with the front office. Please do not come to me to ask for a signature on this, as I can only redirect your request to the front office. If, at the end of the entry period, there are fewer students remaining enrolled than the maximum enrollment of this course, then some of the petitions will be granted. If you're not admitted into the course this term, then you will need to take the course another quarter. Sung and I are both reasonable persons, and we expect that everyone else involved in this class is as well. A word of warning on cheating Please don't. Concern about cheating creates an unpleasant environment for everyone. I don't do a lot to prevent cheating, since preventative measures have huge costs and low return.",
