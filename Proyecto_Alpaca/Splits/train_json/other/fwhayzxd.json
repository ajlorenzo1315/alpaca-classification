Here's the notes he spoke from: - Define linear programming  (NR 10.8.1-10.8.5) objective function nonnegative values (amount of stuff). combinatorial hard polynomial hard define quadratic programming (M 1.11) NP hard algorithms for PSD case (example? - define: feasible vector feasible basic vector (vertex) (no feasible vectors if it's overconstrained) - combinatorial problem: which vertex? - slack variables. turn inequalities into equalities. turn things into standard form. - techniques: simplex method -- generally fast, worst-case exponential searches vertices ellipsoid method -- provably polynomial, impractical closes in on vertices karmakar -- provably polynomial, arguably practical searches interior points - do simplex method for reduced form. (NR 10.8.8, 10.8.9) no objective function! - turn LP into LCP (M 1.9-1.10) - turn LCP into quadratic (trivial: minimize sum of w.z. better be 0!) - can also turn quadratic into LCP. In the above, NR refers to NUMERICAL RECIPES M refers to K.G.Murty, LINEAR COMPLEMENTARITY",
