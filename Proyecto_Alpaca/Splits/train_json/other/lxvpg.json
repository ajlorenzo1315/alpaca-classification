    "Cuerpo": "Click on it to start it up (double-click) and a window named \"Visual Works\" will open up. Double-click on that again and Smalltalk will come up with the main menu list and a workspace. It is stored in the file S:\\visual\\image\\visual.sou Your source code, for both system classes that you modify and new classes that you write, is in your changes file. The system will automatically put all your new code in this changes file. This will be a small text file, which you save on another machine, file into a fresh image, etc. What you need to do is tell Smalltalk about the sources and changes files. When it prompts you for a file name, replace its suggestion with z:\\username\\visual This will save your image in the file visual.im in your directory (it will tack on the .im extension automatically). Finally, you need to change the application associated with your image file (this will allow you to start up Smalltalk by double clicking on your image file in the file manager). To do this, open the Main folder and double click on the File Manager. Find your image file ( z:\\username\\visual.im ) and select it by clicking on it once. However, the fileout files are small, so you can save as many of them as you need. If you want to be safe, you can ftp your fileout files to another machine, such as lynx. Starting Smalltalk again The next time you want to start Smalltalk (on any of the machines -- it doesn't have to be the one you used last time), you can either start from a fresh image, or from the image that you've already been working in. To start from the image you've been working in, go to the folder \"main\", and double click on the File Manager. You can also start from a fresh image at any time by following the directions above for setting up Smalltalk. To create directories simply start up the file manager from the main menu. One problem with ftp is that it doesn't seem to know about your current directory -- you can get around this by giving the full path name for files on the PC. For example, suppose you have a file squid.st in your home directory on the PC, and want to transfer it lynx. This will bring up a dialog box that lets you change your password. To log out from Windows NT go to the file menu of the program manager and choose \"Logout\".",
