    "Cuerpo": "To get the most out of this course, I expect you to: Be prepared to discuss in class and become an active participant in the classroom setting. Remember that even though we may not discuss particular assigned sections in class, you are still responsible for the material and can be tested on it. Contacting Me The best way to contact me is to visit my office during office hours or any other time by appointment. In general it should be no problem to setup an appointment with me to discuss whatever class concerns or questions you might have. Thus if I have e-mail pending and also students waiting at my office, I will attend to the students first and then e-mail. Thus e-mail pertaining to important/relevant class material or general questions on the assignments will be handled first. Questions that are narrow in scope, such as debugging problems that pertain to an individual student, will be handled as time permits. Grading Percentages Your grade is determined by programming assignments, quizzes, and three exams. Individual assignments and exams will not be assigned letter grades. The exact dates and times of these exams will appear on the course syllabus. Quizzes - 10 percent These are short in-class execizes to test your understanding and give feedback on your progress with the course material. The assignments give students practice with C++, and should help prepare students for exams. The readability of a program refers to the ease with which a human reader (such as the grader) can read and understand the source code. The following late policy is provided in case of emergencies, and is not to be used carelessly. Each week has at most three late periods. Once you have used up your grace days, late assignments are deducted 30% for each late period, or fraction of a late period. Worst-case: If you have just about used up the two grace day maximum on an assignment and your program is still not complete, you should turn in what you have with a short paragraph explaining what you still needed to do. However, the solutions to programming assignments should be individual original work. If you have any questions about this policy, or question if a specific action is allowed, please don't hesitate to come and talk to me about these issues. 300 pages should be more than adequate for this class.",
