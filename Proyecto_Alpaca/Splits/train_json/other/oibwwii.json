By working together with a partner, you will be able to communicate with another person as you solve your problem together. This is much like what a software development team has to do in a corporate environment when they are part of an R&D effort, a custom software project, or a new product plan. So, the data structures and algorithms will be a key part of your project, but not the only part. This could include taking a bunch of WWW documents, computing some basic features of them like number of words, links, images, headings, etc., to obtain a \"feature vector\" for each document, and then considering the complete graph on n of these documents with a weight on an edge representing the \"distance\" between its two documents. Using tree and graph data structures to represent and manipulate images or maps. Possibilities include implementing pyramids as multiresolution representations of images or implementing sets of chain codes to represent roads, political boundaries, rivers, and other linear features in maps. Students selecting this option will not need to write a large program in C, C++ or any other traditional language but will do most of their work with a powerful, new visual editor for data structure algorithms. Here is more information on OPSIS. At their core, interpreters for language such as Lisp and Mathematica are list processing systems. You should have chosen a partner (unless you are doing the OPSIS option) and a topic by this time. Your description should include both partners' names, a title for the project, a paragraph explaining your topic and what you hope to accomplish. It should also explain how you and your partner plan to divide up the work. List one or two references you have found that will help you in your project. Between Monday, November 25 and Wednesday, November 27. Project presentations. Late policy for project milestones Topic descriptions received after the due date will have 10% taken off. Teams that do not meet with me by December 2 will have 10% taken off the whole project grade. Project reports turned in after 12:35 on Dec. 11 but by 12:00 on Dec 12 will be docked 10% of the project grade, and there will be another 10% off for each business day the report is late. S.
