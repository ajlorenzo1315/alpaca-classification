Weld Morocco is a cultural mosaic --- a curious mix of Arab customs, Berber traditions, and French sophistication. Moroccan cuisine, for example, makes fresh bread, jam and cafe au lait the standard petit dejeuner, but a dinner of tagine (an exotic vegetable stew) is always followed by supersweet mint tea (jokingly called ``Berber Whiskey'' in the strictly Muslim nation). We sampled this mosaic in an all-too-brief trip in September `94. Two days in this exotic but much touristed city were enough, so we rented a tiny Renault 4, crossed the high Atlas mountains, braved a sandstorm in the Sahara, and arrived a week later in Fez where we spent our final few days. Before our trip, many travelers had warned us of the numerous hassles --- insistent and unwanted offers from would-be ``guides'' who wouldn't understand ``No.'' In almost every town we visited, someone invited us to their house for dinner or to spend the night. Perched high on cliffy knolls were picturesque {\\em kasbahs}, adobe fortresses with thick walls and slitlike windows; built centuries ago to defend the agricultural wealth from the raids of camel-bound nomads, many are still occupied today. We gave a teenage hitchhiker a lift to his house at the paved road's end, and liked his happy-go-lucky nature so much that we later asked him to be our guide for a hike into the hills. As we climbed, the vistas grew ever more stupendous, but the mountains seemed so bleak, I couldn't imagine anyone living in them. But our guide Mohammed was right, and we soon came to the summer camp of a family of Berber nomads. The woman was off tending the sheep, but the man invited us into their smoke-blackened cave, sat us down on a fine kilim carpet, boiled some water on a small twig fire, and served us syrupy sweet mint tea. It was clearly a hard life, but one which had been followed for generations. Eventually we descended to the Dades river and followed it downstream to a narrow gorge. After cleaning up from our hike, we drove our Renault to Mohammed's parents' house where half the town had assembled in the street. Cheering, the crowd surged for the road. inside the tiny vehicle, set the hazards flashing in the gathering dusk, pressed hard on the horn, and eased thru the procession of wellwishers in an oozing traffic jam that slowly rolled thru the streets towards a monumental party, which was assembling at the groom's house. While we never actually went inside, later in the evening we were able to watch an hour of dancing from the side of a jam-packed courtyard which served as the dance floor. Nearby, country women sold vegetables, squatting by blue tarps piled high with produce. Each night, at dusk, the streets flooded with a tide of people. There seemed only one rule to the roads, and that was the urgent cry ``Balak, balak'' which warned of an approaching donkey, heavily laden with firewood or perhaps with fresh hides, dripping from the tannery.",
