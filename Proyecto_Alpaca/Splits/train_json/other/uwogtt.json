Believe it or not, this is more or less how the lab looks on a daily basis. The CSRVL consists of two adjoining rooms on the 3rd floor of Upson Hall at Cornell University. The main lab is used by faculty and students involved in research in robotics and machine vision. Therein can be found all of the equipment needed to build, test, debug, and run experiments with our mobile robots, along with a number of workstations and personal computers used in machine vision processing as well for programming the mobots. These include CS463, an undergraduate course in vision and robotics, and CS664, a graduate seminar in machine vision. The teaching lab contains a dozen Sparc IPX and IPC machines for use by these students, as well as the Puma and Zebra robotic arms. A view of the hallway outside the lab, 3rd floor Upson.
