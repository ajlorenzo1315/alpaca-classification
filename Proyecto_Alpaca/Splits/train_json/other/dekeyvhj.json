    "Cuerpo": "What to Do The restaurant only has four items on the menu. You need to keep a running total of what is ordered and loop until the cash register operator asks the program to print out the total bill. Also, you must keep track of how many of each item are purchased and display them in the final bill. Be creative with the name of your restaurant, what sorts of food your restaurant offers, and what the prices are (or, if you lack the imagination, you can use the menu shown below). The Hamburger Shack ------------------------------- A. Hamburger            $1.00 B.  Cheeseburger         $1.20 C.  Double Cheeseburger  $2.40 D.  Bacon Cheeseburger   $2.00 Quit adding items, and print the bill Current Subtotal:  $0.00 Enter your selection --> At this point, the cash register operator might press \"A\" (or, they might press \"a\". Your program should do the same thing either way). You should add the cost of item A to the running subtotal and redisplay the menu with the updated subtotal: Enter your selection --> A New subtotal is $1.00 The Hamburger Shack ------------------------------- A. Hamburger            $1.00 B.  Cheeseburger         $1.20 C.  Double Cheeseburger  $2.40 D.  Bacon Cheeseburger   $2.00 Quit adding items, and print the bill Current Subtotal: $1.00 Enter your selection --> When the operator chooses \"Q\" from the menu, your program should print out an itemized list of what was ordered (and the total cost for each item), the subtotal, the sales tax (use 5% for sales tax), and the total (subtotal + sales tax). For example: Enter your selection --> q Customer Bill ------------- 1 Hamburger            $1.00 2 Cheeseburger         $2.40 1 Bacon Cheeseburger   $2.00 ------ Subtotal               $5.40 Sales Tax              $0.27 ====== Amount Due             $5.67 Notice that two cheeseburgers were ordered in this example, so the cost is listed as 2 times $1.20, or $2.40. Also notice that since no double cheeseburgers were ordered, they are not mentioned on the bill (it does not say \" 0 Double Cheeseburger \"). What To Hand In As in program 1, you will hand in a printed copy of both your source code and the output displayed when the program is run. The printed output should demonstrate all of the features of your program. Also, don't forget to have your program print your name and section number, so that they show up on all of your printouts! mbirk@cs.wisc.edu",
