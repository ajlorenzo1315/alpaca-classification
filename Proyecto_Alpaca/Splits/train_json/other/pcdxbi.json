We define a controlled object to be an object containing methods which allows users to manipulate properties of that object. A cooperatively controlled object (CCO) is a controlled object which may be simultaneously manipulated by one or more users. One major difference is the nature of the relationship between the object and how it is controlled. The more complicated this relationship, the more the object is Cooperatively Controlled. Example Figure 1 shows an example where a point is controlled by decomposing it into its x and y coordinates which are modified by separate users. A cooperatively controlled point, on the other hand, may involve a more general functional relationship between user inputs and controlled properties. For example, the controlled point could be determined by the intersection of two lines controlled by four users, each user directly manipulating the location of one of two points on a line with a mouse. The interaction between users of a FGSO is not, by definition, synchronous. A CCO, on the other hand, may require more than one user to synchronously manipulate the object. In order to ensure that users control an object synchronously, all users must be informed that their input is needed in the manipulation of that object. For example, if a user wishes to manipulate an object, they would select a specific tool and use that to modify that object. CoImage Activities We have currently designed and partially implemented three collaborative activities. Currently each puzzle piece is modified by a single user (although users can work simultaneously), but eventually users will be forced to rotate each piece together. In this activity, users manipulate a point to draw a picture on the screen. Currently the point is shared by scroll bars controlling the x and y coordinates, but we will soon implement other cooperative control of the drawing point.
