Enter keywords in this box (e.g., \"digital library\") to search the author, title, and abstract fields of the bibliographic entries for technical reports. The search returns documents whose bibliographic entries contain all the words you enter in either the author, title, or abstract fields. First, there are three text entry fields for bibliographic keyword entry, and two radio buttons to specify whether the keywords entered should be \"anded\" or \"ored\" together. Second, there is a menu of the publishers in the NCSTRL collection, and a check box to use all publishers. Finally, there is a text entry field in which you may specify a document identifer. To specify search criteria, do the following: If you wish to specify search criteria based on bibliographic keywords (author, title or abstract), fill one of the keyword fields (see the rules for bibliographic keyword matching ) : Author - The author's first or last name or names . Abstract - The words in the abstract of the document. Your entry will be matched against any substring of the document identifiers; e.g., the entry \"94\" will match \"94-1435\" and \"89-194\". A document identifier entry is always \"anded\" to bibliographic keyword entries; i.e., only documents which meet the bibliographic keyword criteria and the document name criteria will be returned. Please take note that not all documents in the collection have abstracts . Your search criteria will be rejected if you don't select at least one publisher (or the \"all\" checkbox), and specify at least one bibliographic keyword or a document identifier. Rules for bibliographic keyword matching Words that you enter in the three bibliographic keyword fields ( Author , Title , Abstract ) are matched to bibliographic entries according to the following rules: Each word that you enter matches any word in the respective field that begins with respective word. You may choose either the logical connector AND or OR between the bibliographic keyword fields by using one of the radio buttons below the fields. For example, if you select the or button and the word \"robot\" in the Title field and \"robotics\" in the Abstract field, the search will return documents that have either \"robot\" in their titles or \"robotics\" in their abstracts. For example, if you enter \"robotics or vision\" in the abstract field, the search will return documents that have the word \"robotics\" or \"vision\" in their abstracts. If you enter \"robotics and vision\" in the abstract field, the search will return documents that have both the word \"robotics\" and \"vision\" in their abstracts. For example, if you enter \"computer vision\" in the abstract field, the search will return documents that have both the words \"computer\" and \"vision\" in their abstracts. For example, if you enter \"Gries or (Teitelbaum and Field)\" in the author field, the search will return documents authored by \"Gries\" or by \"Teitelbaum\" and \"Field\". Note: Do not use short, common words or single letters in the bibliographic keyword fields ( e.g., \"the\", \"a\", \"s\").",
