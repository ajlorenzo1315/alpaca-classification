You will type in the C++ program on the second page of this lab, compile it, and execute it. Finally, you will copy another program, make some changes to it, and report on what happens. This command will call the C++ compiler but will also tell the compiler where to look for our string class and to link it in when we use it. In the command tool (shell), type the following boldface commands. You can also use it for compiling all your other C++ programs for this class. Drag over its name and call it hello.cc. Include your name in the comments. Compile and Execute Move to the command tool. Submit your Program In the command tool, use submit and think about your answers to give it to your class's account as the hello lab. Note that the name to use for submitting is usually at the top of the lab handout. Use Save As to change its name to bdaygood.cc and put it in your Labs directory. Then use Save As again to name it bday.cc. At this point you have two copies of the file in your Labs directory. Be sure to save your program changes before you try to compile and always undo the change before trying the next change. Changes Exploration For this portion of the lab, you will make changes to a C++ program. You will save the broken program and try to compile it. When you finish, make sure the program is in its correct state, save it, and turn in your observations for grading. For each change, start with the original program. Click in your observations file where you want the text to be placed.",
