    "Cuerpo": "Your assignment is to add the functionality described below and write up the issues you encountered. The writeup will include what aspects of the program made it easy to modify and what aspects made it difficult. (This can include non-design issues, like documentation, particularly if the program was well documented.) What to code Add the following functionality to the formatter: Add the <HR> (horizontal rule) tag. The <HR> tag does not need a </HR> tag, and any </HR> tags can be ignored. Add a LENGTH attribute to the <HR> tag. If value of the length attribute is an integer, then the length of the line of dashes is min(LENGTH, width of output) , otherwise it is the width of the output. Add a JUSTIFY attribute to the <HR> tag. The horizontal rule is either left justified or center justified appropriately. Some examples: (1) Add <HR> tag DoOd! horizontal <HR> rulez. Is output as DoOd! horizontal -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- rules. (2) Add LENGTH attribute This is your invoice: <LI> Widgets...... $15.99 <LI> Gadgets...... $12.97 <HR LENGTH=30> <LI> Total........ $28.96 <UL> Is output as This is your invoice: * Widgets....... $15.99 * Gadgets....... $12.97 ------------------------------ * Total......... $28.96 (3) Add JUSTIFY attribute This is your brain on invoice... <HR LENGTH=30 JUSTIFY=CENTER> AAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrggghh! Is output as This is your brain on invoice... ------------------------------ AAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrggghh! What to write up The write up should include a discussion of what parts of the program needed to be modified to incorporate each new piece of functionality, what changes to the interfaces between modules were necessary, and how well the design allowed for change overall. You should describe what changes you would make to the program to make it easier to modify, while keeping within the design. I will forward your writeup to the group whose program you modified.
