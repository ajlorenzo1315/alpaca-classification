    "Cuerpo": "U-Net is available on several platforms: PCs running Windows NT 4.0 and using a DECchip 21140 based fast ethernet interface. The initial versions of U-Net were developed under contract F30602-94-C-0224 from Rome Laboratory, Air Force Material Command. Please send mail to Matt Welsh for questions or problems about this release. There is little or no reason to use this release, except that it includes U-Net Active Messages 1.1 and a different implementation of libunet . User-level network interfaces allow applications direct access to the network without operating system inter-vention on every send and receive. This approach is inflexible in that it requires data to be copied into and out of this memory region, and does not scale to a large number of processes. This paper presents an extension to the U-Net user-level network architecture (U-Net/MM) allowing messages to be transferred directly to and from any part of an application’s address space. ATM and Fast Ethernet Network Interfaces for User-level Communication , Matt Welsh, Anindya Basu, and Thorsten von Eicken. Fast Ethernet and ATM are two attractive network technologies for interconnecting workstation clusters for parallel and distributed computing. This paper compares network interfaces with and without programmable co-processors for the two types of networks using the U-Net communication architecture to provide low-latency and high-bandwidth communication. U-Net provides protected, user-level access to the network interface and offers application-level round-trip latencies as low as 60 usec over Fast Ethernet and 90 usec over ATM. The paper provides detailed performance analysis of U-Net for Fast Ethernet and ATM, including application-level performance on a set of Split-C parallel benchmarks. Low-Latency Communication over Fast Ethernet , Matt Welsh, Anindya Basu, Thorsten von Eicken. We use a network architecture based on the U-Net approach to implement low-latency and high-bandwidth communication over Fast Ethernet, with performance rivaling (and in some cases exceeding) that of 155 Mbps ATM. U-Net: A User-Level Network Interface for Parallel and Distributed Computing , Anindya Basu, Vineet Buch, Werner Vogels, Thorsten von Eicken. Proceedings of the 15th ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP), Copper Mountain, Colorado, December 3-6, 1995. The U-Net communication architecture provides processes with a virtual view of a network interface to enable user-level access to high-speed communication devices. The architecture, implemented on standard workstations using off-the-shelf ATM communication hardware, removes the kernel from the communication path, while still providing full protection. The model presented by U-Net allows for the construction of protocols at user level whose performance is only limited by the capabilities of network. The U-Net User-Level Network Architecture .",
