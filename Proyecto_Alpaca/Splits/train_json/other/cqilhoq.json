    "Cuerpo": "The Appalachian Association of Sacred Harp Singers is an informal group that meets to sing from the Sacred Harp shape-note tradition. We also sing from Southern Harmony. Our monthly sings generally draw about 12 singers. Our yearly convention is attended by about 40 singers from surrounding states. We always have extra books (which you can buy if you want) at our sings. Everyone who wants gets a chance to pick and lead songs; we provide free \"on the job\" training. We meet the second Sunday of every month except June, July, and August at the Chapel Hill Presbyterian Church in Lexington , Kentucky (corner of Tates Creek and Armstrong Mill). We have held the convention in the Pisgah Presbyterian Church a few miles West of Lexington since 1995. We also present occasional concerts at local churches and art venues. What is shape note? The books we sing from use a 4-shape scheme, with the notes in a major scale as follows: Can I see some? You might look at Lansdowne , set to shape note by Raphael Finkel , a member of our group. What are our favorite songs? Follow this link to see what we sang at the 1995 Kentucky State Sacred Harp Convention.
