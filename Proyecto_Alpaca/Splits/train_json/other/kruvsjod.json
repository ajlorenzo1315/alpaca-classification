In this form, the radix point is always placed one place to the right of the first significant symbol (as above). For example, a number given as 3.6  really implies that this number is in the range of 3.6 +- .05,   which is 3.55 to 3.65 This is 2 significant digits. So, the number of significant digits given in a number tells about how accurately the number is known. The larger the number of significant digits, the better the accuracy. No matter what accuracy of a number is known, they give lots of digits in an number. For example, if you do the operation 1.2  x  2.2. given that each number has 2 significant digits, a correct answer is example: 101.001 (binary) 1 x 2**2 + 1 x 2**0 + 1 x 2**-3 4     +    1     +  1/8 5  1/8  = 5.125 (decimal) fraction  fraction x 2  digit left of point .8          1.6              1 <-- most significant (f  ) .6          1.2              1                        -1 .2          0.4              0 .4          0.8              0 .8  (it must repeat from here!) example: 101.001 (octal) 1 x 8**2 + 1 x 8**0 + 1 x 8**-3 64     +    1     +  1/512 65  1/512  = 65.0019 (approx)",
