    "Cuerpo": "As computer consultants, we assist researchers in choosing hardware and software that will best fill their needs, we maintain systems, instruct users on the use of hardware and software, and promote an integrated and compatible environment so that data can easily be exchanged. These services fall under the normal duties of computer support, but we also provide additional services and it is these services that this page describes. Short History of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology multimedia services Description of Our Services: Multimedia services we provide are not precisely defined; they are limited by software and hardware resources, time constraints, and personnel capabilities. What we recommend, is to discuss with us what you would like done and, together, we can determine the best means of implementing the idea. The most important constraint on the work we have done in the past is time. The more time we have to work on a project, the better the results will be. I recommend coming in to see us as soon as you begin thinking about a project. We are very willing to help you with any animation and or video work you have, but video projects are very time consuming and we have many things to do besides video work. Services Provided: 3D Modeling and Rendering 3D models of biological systems can be created and animated to demonstrate processes. (See the Anaphase animation in the 3D Modeling and Rendering page.) Titles screens, transitions and various effects can be created to supplement videos. Morphing Development can be simulated by obtaining still images at successive stages and morphing from one to the next. (See the Embryogenesis project in the morph page.) Many interesting effects can be created. Transitions/Effects Titles screens which can include still images or animations. Transitions between video segments including fades, wipes, or animations. 3D graphics and animations, morphs and 2D animations can be incorporated. Printing to Video Still frames, animations, title screens, and audio tracks can all be printed to video an viewed on standard video players. These constraints are fully explained in this section. It is also meant as a showcase for our services, so that those in the building can get a feel for what services we can provide for them, and those out of the building can see what we are about, what we have done, and hopefully benefit from our experience.",
