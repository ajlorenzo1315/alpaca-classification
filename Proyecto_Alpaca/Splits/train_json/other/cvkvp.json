The (un)constitutionality of the Act has not been definitively established, since the panel has not held a trial nor has the decision been reviewed by the Supreme Court. In an action for preliminary injunction on constitutional grounds, such as ACLU v. Reno , the federal statute dealing with district court civil procedure provides for an expedited review by a three-judge court, one of whom (Buckwalter) is the judge that heard the preliminary testimony and evidence. A hearing on a request for a preliminary injunction is not equivalent to a full trial on the merits. (There are additional requirements, including \"irreparable harm\", that a plaintiff must show to get a preliminary injunction;  but in a First Amendment context those additional requirements are not controversial.) The panel did not need to reach the question of the constitutionality of the \"Comstock Act\" provisions dealing with information about abortion, since the Government apparently conceded its unconstitutionality without further argument: The Government has stated that it does not contest plaintiffs' challenge to the enforceability of the provision of the CDA as it relates to 18 U.S.C. 1462(c). An important part of the impact of the case is the set of factual assumptions on which the reasoning was based. The most important finding was the following (# 88): Communications over the Internet do not \"invade\" an individual's home or appear on one's computer screen unbidden. Users seldom encounter content \"by accident.\" This finding allowed the judges to distinguish the Internet from the \"invasive\" radio broadcast in Pacifica . Another important \"fact\" on which the opinion rested (at least in part) was the incompleteness of the Government's proposed \"tagging\" scheme. Discussion about Pacifica . The panel believed that the specific Carlin monologue would also be treated as \"indecent\" under the CDA. Therefore, in order to find the CDA unconstitutional, the panel would have to distinguish Pacifica . The panel pointed to several possible grounds for distinguishing the Pacifica case. The Administration argued against the Decency Act during the Congressional legislative process, but now the same Justice Department is in the posture of arguing to uphold it. It seems to me that this is perfectly appropriate;  one wouldn't want an Administration as a rule to undercut Congressional legislation by selectively choosing whether or not to enforce laws based on its political views. Interestingly, though, the panel pointed to a 1995 Justice Department letter (arguing that the Decency Act was unnecessary to combat child pornography) as undercutting any claim of a \"compelling governmental interest\".",
