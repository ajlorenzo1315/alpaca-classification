    "Cuerpo": "I'm recording the various things I have done, am doing, or have scheduled to do to my house. The first week I have my truck back from the body shop ... A tree falls on my house! Once I started work on this I discovered that the sill plate of the door, some of the surrounding brick molding, the house siding, and the deck joists in that area were all rotted out. To fix this, I need to remove the deck, so I can remove the patio door and rebuild the rotted members. The morning arrives and I find some water in the basement! Voila; water in the basement. I also purchased a rear bagger with my mower. Dehumidifier I have lots of stuff stored in my basement, and I need to keep it dry. I discovered this when I needed to open them to flush some gas fumes from the basement! Clean, repair, and reseal the Deck. Clean paint drips from the trim, built-in furniture and floors. Install window well covers. Repair or replace the double-paned glass in the patio door. Replace the sink drain in the master bathroom. I wish I had started keeping track of these items earlier, so I could look here to find the impressive list of things I had already done. I have no idea of what it is. It was easier to do this from the roof than with a ladder. This also removed a tremendous amount of debris and dead grass. Clean the water softener. There are two types of salt for the softener, pellet and crystal .",
