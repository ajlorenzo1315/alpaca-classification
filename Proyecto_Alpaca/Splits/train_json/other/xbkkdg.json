    "Cuerpo": "BIRCH is a system designed for doing clustering and density analysis for any large dataset with a limited resources (memory or time) while minimizing I/O cost. What is new in BIRCH All previous data clustering or density analysis methods treat each individual data point equally important. BIRCH can find a good clustering or density estimation with a single scan of the dataset. BIRCH tries to find the best clustering or density estimation under the given resources (memory or time) , and allows tradeoff between different resources (memory and time) to achieve similar analysis quality. Within it there are 100 clusters, each of which is a normal distribution of 900 tuples, distributed along a sine curve. The rest 10,000 (i.e., 10% of total) tuples are uniformly distributed noises. Now we apply BIRCH to the above dataset to search for the 100 clusters. With 80 kbytes of memory and less than 1 minute on a HP9000 unix workstation, we find the 100 clusters, each of which is plotted as a circle with the number of tuples in it labeled, its centroid as center, and its standard deviation as radius. (2) Real-world application: pixel classification The above are two similar images of trees with a partly cloudy sky as the background, taken in two different wavelengths. Each image contains 512x1024 pixels, and each pixel actually has a pair of brightness values corresponding to VIS and NIR. Soil scientists receive hundreds of such image pairs and try to first classify pixels into different categories such as background, sunlit leaves, shadows and branches, and then apply further statistical analysis. The scatter plot of (VIR,NIR) for all pairs of pixels in the image (512x1024 2-d tuples). With 400 kbytes of memory and less than 6 minutes on a HP9000 unix workstation, we can find 6 clusters corresponding to clouds, ordinary part of sky, very bright part of sky, tree branches, shadows on the tree, and sublit leaves. The following shows the pixels corresponding to sunlit leaves, tree branches and shadows on the trees classified with BIRCH.
