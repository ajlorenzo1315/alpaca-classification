I don't know if that's still true, or was ever true, but for an urban population around 200,000 this statement paints a pretty accurate picture: except in the very coldest Wisconsin weather, when only a few folks (like myself) are crazy enough to venture out on two wheels, Madison teems with bicycles and bicyclists. Madison is also the home to the primary campus of the University of Wisconsin, which is home to roughly 30,000 undergraduates, and 12,000 graduate students. You might think they would be difficult to tell apart ... It is probably not that remarkable, considering kids today :-) Every person on campus, on a bicycle, wearing a helmet, is a graduate student (or faculty member). Stated another way, none of the undergraduates riding bicycles (but most of the graduates) wear helmets. A useful application of the helmet theory is that, if you are curious to know if a cyclist is a graduate or an undergraduate, see whether they've got a plastic-and-styrofoam brain-protector. But Why?!!! We can thereby conclude, given the correctness of the Helmet Theory, that none of them attended Wisconsin. On another level, this is positively crazy. take the most elementary precaution to saving their respective lives. My guess about why so few undergrads wear helmets is because they are perceived as being, on whatever level, uncool . Perhaps it is not possible to get a date if you wear a bicycle helmet? One of my students, when I brought this up in class, postulated that perhaps the dichotomy between grads and undergrads vis-a-vis the helmet phenomenon arises because \"they [the grads] have more to lose.\" Yiii!! The graduate students have already progressed past those pleasantly distracting and carefree undergraduate years, and have hopefully learned important and useful things that the race would like to pass along to future generations. Postscript The inability of Wisconsin undergraduates to wear helmets is reminiscent of something that I noticed in high school. Golly. wisc . edu",
