Copies of CodeWarrior 8 can be purchased from the Campus Store. The CodeWarrior installed in the CIT labs is just like the one you would install on your Mac, except for a few things we have added -- the CSLib library and the CS100 Basic project stationery. Once you have retrieved the CS100 Additions folder, install the additions as follows: Open the CS100 Additions folder. There are two folders called INTO MacOS Support and INTO (Project Stationery). The folder structure in the CS100 Additions folder is meant to mirror the folder structure inside the Metrowerks CodeWarrior folder of your copy of CodeWarrior, to make it easy to follow these instructions. Open the Metrowerks CodeWarrior folder inside it. Open the INTO MacOS Support folder in the CS100 additions. Move the CS100 Support folder into the MacOS Support folder in your Metrowerks CodeWarrior folder. Open the INTO (Project Stationery) folder. Move the CS100 Basic 68K.mu file into the (Project Stationery) folder in your Metrowerks CodeWarrior folder. Stat. Support folder in the INTO (Project Stationery) folder. Move the .c file into the Project Stationery Support folder in the (Project Stationery) folder of your CodeWarrior. When you open a new project with CodeWarrior, you should now be able to select the CS100 Basic 68K stationery. CS100 Additions Folder Other Machines If you have a copy of CodeWarrior for a computer other than the Mac, you may still be able to set up the CS100 environment. Compile the source code on your machine using CodeWarrior. Put the compiled library and the library header files into the support directory for your CodeWarrior. Put your project stationery in the project stationery directory of your CodeWarrior. CS100 Spring 1996 pierce@cs.cornell.edu",
