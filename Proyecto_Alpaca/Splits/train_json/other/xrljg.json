The NSF has designated the integration of Web browsers into the client workstation desktop as a research priority for the World Wide Web . If done right, we believe, it would assist the user in the organization and access of this content so that items found once could be easily found again. In today's \"desktop\" interfaces there are different ways of organizing and displaying local and Web resources: Local Resources Hierarchical file systems Hierarchical viewers (2D and 3D) Nested \"folders\" Program groups Varying degrees of support for direct manipulation (\"drag-and-drop\") Web Resources Hot list (with or without limited nesting) Bookmarks (with or without limited nesting) Menu driven or dialog driven control ...or we write our own HTML pages Problems Before discussing what exactly is meant by \"integration of a browser into a desktop,\" let's list some of the problems casual users seem to have using the Web. Is the purpose of a home page to organize the owner's view of the Web? Preliminary User Studies on Organization and Navigation To focus on the ways in which a user retains and organizes access to Web documents, we studied a novice Web user in a In the next section we'll try to explain how this would work. Use icons to represent Web pages Use hierachical or nested views to organized Web pages. Icons can be generated and saved to desktop view Paper Prototype Design We've included a description and drawings to tour our design . Several 3D hierachy views could be used to visualize the user's organization of Web documents. 3D visualization may be more useful for navigation and exploration of the Web than organization. We have envisioned an extension to these metaphors that attempts to make network resources appear similar to local resources. In class we mentioned several metaphors for Web access that differ greatly from the desktop metaphor:  The Web as an ocean, the Web as a highway, for example. We discussed these metaphors and decided that they have more use as metaphors for navigation and browsing (e.g. \"fishing\", \"trawling\", \"wandering\", \"road trip\"). The objects and the services could be local or remote. This would associate services with objects similar to the MIME concept. The desktop appears to be a suitable way for users to organize their personal views of the Web. The interface could support personal annotations by overlaying the document page with \"Post-It\" type annotations that could be stuck anywhere on the document. These would be associated with, and accessible from, the document icon. Often these pages have no content of their own, or may contain personal annotations. As an extension it would neither force authors to use it nor viewing software to present it differently from a document.",
