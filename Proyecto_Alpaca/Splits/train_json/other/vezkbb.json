Required Text: Foley, van Dam, Feiner, Hughes. Optional texts: OpenGL Reference Manual . Addison-Wesley, 1992. Jackie Neider, Tom Davis, and Mason Woo. OpenGL Programming Guide . Addison-Wesley, 1993. Josie Wernecke, The Inventor Mentor . Addison-Wesley, 1994. Grading: Project (same grade for whole team): 30%+ Project knowledge (individual): 15% Project write-up (individual): 5% Project artifact (individual): 5%+ Written assignments: 25% Final: 20% (A \"+\" denotes an area in which extra credit can be earned.) Projects: This is the second year that CSE/457 is being taught using our new graphics instructional lab consisting of 14 Silicon Graphics Indy R4400s. You'll work indvidually only on the first project (Project #0). For the next three projects, you'll work with a team of 2 to 3 students. Projects will be graded during in-person sessions with one of the TAs . During the grading session, a TA will run the project to make sure that it conforms to the project guidelines. One grade will be assigned for all members of the team for the project's implementation. A third component of the grade is based on your individual project write-up. This means that the modification stamp on the project executable must be earlier than the start of lecture on the due date. Late assignments are marked down at a rate of 33% per day (not per lecture), meaning that if you fail to turn in an assignment on time it is worth 66% for the first 24 hours after the deadline, 33% for the next 24 hours, and it is worth nothing after that. In addition, no extra credit for bells and whistles will be awarded for any late assignment .",
