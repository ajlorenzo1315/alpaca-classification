If you are unfamiliar with Windows and don't want to \"jump right in,\" then check out the Introduction to Microsoft Windows . :-) What to Do First, you must go to the lab in 1350 Comp Sci & St and log in. Since you will be starting a new program, choose \"File\" and then \"New\" from the menu. This will bring up a blank editing window for you to enter your program. Now you are ready to type in the source code for Program 0. (In case you didn't bring your book, click here to see the source code.) Now, so that you know which program is yours when you print it out, add a comment (a line beginning with two slashes) at the top of your program with your name and other information. For instance, the top few lines of your program might look something like this: // John Q. Doe   CS110 Section 7 // Program 0: Sample C++ Program After you have entered the source code, give you program a name by choosing \"File\" and then \"Save as\" from the menu. In the window that pops up, type prog0 . Now, compile and run the program by clicking on the small \"lightning bolt\" icon (or choose \"Debug\" and then \"Run\" from the menu). This will bring up yet another window, which asks you to enter the number of \"pods\" and \"peas in a pod,\" then calculates and prints the number of \"peas in all.\" If, when trying to run your program, you get \"errors\" instead of a blank window, this means that you made a typo when entering the source code. After you've tested the program and are certain it is working, print a hard copy by selecting \"File\" and then \"Print\" from the menu. Click \"OK\" on the window which pops up. This printout will show up on one of the laser printers in room 1359. That's it! You can now exit Borland C++ by choosing \"File\" and then \"Exit\" from the menu. To log out of the system, choose \"File\" and then \"Exit Windows\" from the Program Manager window. mbirk@cs.wisc.edu",
