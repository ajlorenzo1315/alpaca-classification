    "Cuerpo": "First off, I love to travel, and there's just no better way to see and experience the countryside than by bike. You see more than you do when going by car because -- let's face it -- you're going slower. It's also easier to stop to see those deer or take in that view. Biking is low impact, highly aerobic, and easy to improve in quickly. Finally, it's a great way to experience nature. When you're getting away from it all, you can leave it further behind if you don't have a car. For those of you who care about such things, this is my trusty steed, a Fisher Zebrano hybrid that I've modified for touring. I've had it for a year, and put about 5500 miles on it. The Great Pacific Coast Bike Ride In August, I set out with some especially shady characters on a bicycle expedition down the Pacific Coast, from Seattle to San Francisco (I continued on to San Diego). These comrades-in-lycra were Marc Friedman , Ruben Ortega , and Jim Giordano . Despite eating on the bikes, we were generally very hungry by the time we stopped for lunch. 348.5 Washburne State Park 428.6 Sunset Bay State Park 489.4 Humbug Mountain State Park. No room at the Inn. 86 miles to a campground at... 966.3 Olema. Then missed the tunnel to... 1015. Left Ruben & Jim in San Francisco. Met Jane! San Simeon State Beach 1387. Met Eddie Fitzgerald, alleged holder of world's record bike trip -- 130,000 miles, and still going. Huntington Beach (Colonial Inn Hostel) 1717.",
