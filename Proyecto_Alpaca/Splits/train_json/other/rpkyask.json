    "Cuerpo": "You have to design a (fairly) simple arcade game, draw the graphics and program the inner workings of your game. You have three weeks to create a working arcade game, so design and software engineer carefully to make sure you are done. The most important thing that we're looking for is a working game. When you design your game make sure you can finish the project within the three week time frame. You won't get a good grade if your final game is just pong with different colors and a bigger paddle. Your game doesn't have to be original (i.e. a clone of a classic arcade game is fine) but it should be something you are proud to hand in. Is the game well designed? We will be looking at your code and the easier it is to read and follow the better mood we will be in when it comes time to decide on a grade. Tools To do this assignment you will need to use a C/C++ compiler (such as Borland C++ 4.2 which is available on CAEN machines), the Arcade Package (which is available on the class webpage), and a paint program (such as the Windows Paint program also available on CAEN machines). C/C++ Compiler The Borland C/C++ compiler is available on CAEN machines and should work well for this project. The Arcade Package This code has been written specifically for this assignment. It handles all of the low level stuff that is such a pain in game programming. On the class website you will find a simple Pong program which was written with the Arcade Package. All you have to do is replace the pong code with your game. Notes on the Arcade Package: The Arcade Package is written in C and C++. On Wednesday half of the lecture will be an introduction to the Arcade Package. Paint Program You will have to create graphics for each of your game objects. Printouts of all your code. A write-up containing an explanation of your code (what the data structures are and how the program is organized) and anything special that you would like to point out to the grader. If bugs are found in the Arcade Package we will announce them in class and on the class webpage.",
