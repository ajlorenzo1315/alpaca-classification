    "Cuerpo": "This course covers the foundations of 2- and 3- dimensional computer graphics. In the first part of the course we will develop the theory and implement a simple 3-dimensional graphics system from scratch. In the remainder of the course we will use the OpenGL graphics library to implement complex 3-dimensional scenes employing smooth curves and surfaces, color, lighting, atmospheric effects, textures, etc. Is This Course for You? OF COURSE! There will be a considerable amount of programming in this course using your choice of C or C++. Finally, the OpenGL Reference Manual is convenient to have, but is not required. The last four weeks of the course will be devoted to a project of your choice. The project will be presented to the class at the end of the semester. There will be three deadlines associated with each homework assignment. If your homework is submitted before the Early Deadline , you will receive a 10 percent bonus on the assignment. If your homework is submitted after the Regular Deadline but before the Late Deadline , 10 percent will be deducted from your grade. Collaboration Policy You are welcome and encouraged to discuss an approach to a problem and you may, of course, help one another to debug code. Raster graphics and scan conversion algorithms. 2-D transformations. Object hierarchy. Blending and antialiasing. Texture mapping. Fractal models. Recursive ray tracing.",
