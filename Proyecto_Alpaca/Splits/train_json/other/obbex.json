CS211  Computers and Programming Intermediate programming in a high-level language and introduction to computer science. Pascal is the principal programming language. CS212 Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs A challenging introduction to programming languages and computer science. Topics include recursive and higher-order procedures, performance analysis of algorithms, proofs of program correctness, probabilistic algorithms, symbolic hierarchical data, abstract data types, polymorphic functions, object-oriented programming, infinite data types, simulation, and the interpretation and compilation of programs. CS214 A Taste of Unix® and C An introduction to Unix operating systems and their programming environments. In the first three weeks, we cover the architecture of Unix operating systems and the C language at a high level. Topics covered in the course include: representation of information; machine/assembly languages, in particular PowerPC; processor organization; interrupts and I/O; memory hierarchies; combinatorial and sequential circuits; data path and control unit design; RTL; and microprogramming. It involves a good deal of programming and development experience, and tries to simulate the life of professional programmers. Topics include the C++ language, Object-oriented programming, software design issues, classical software engineering, and collaborative programming. Relationship between language and data structure, emphasizing abstract data types. Detailed study of searching and sorting methods. All the programming for the project is in a high-level language. Credit will not be given for both. CS631 Multimedia Systems An investigation of the computer science issues related to multimedia systems. Topics include: coding and compression, storage systems, high-speed networking, video/audio processing, user interface issues, and databases for multimedia. CS681 Analysis of Algorithms Methodology for developing efficient algorithms, primarily for graph theoretic problems. Additional topics such as parallel algorithms and efficient data structures. CS775 Seminar in Natural Language Understanding Covers current topics in natural language understanding, computational linguistics, and relevant areas of machine learning. Information from previous semesters Information from previous semesters may be retained for a while, but don't be surprised if certain links don't work.",
