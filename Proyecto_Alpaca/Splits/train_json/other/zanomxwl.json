Graduate Course Descriptions Campus Information for Graduate Studies including the Graduate Catalog for 1994-1996 Information primarily for enrolled graduate students: Graduate Program Policy Manual (also available in postscript format ) Deadlines for Graduate Students Graduate Announcements (CS only) Graduate Student Newsgroup (UMCP only) Executive Council of Computer Science Grad Students Finding Fellowships Notes on Jeff Hollingsworth's talk on \"Managing a Job Search\" (seminar done Jan/18/95) A Quick Introduction With an annual research budget of several million dollars, the department's research projects are at the cutting edge of computer science innovation and discovery. Faculty  are working in nearly every area of computer science, and there are seven active, well-established research groups in: artificial intelligence computer systems computer vision / geometric computing database systems programming languages / software engineering scientific computing theory of computing A list of faculty and research areas is available. More Research Opportunities Several independent research units on the College Park campus have strong ties to the Department of Computer Science. Your application must be received by the Graduate School on or before that date or it will not be processed. Forms are available from the Graduate School and also from the Computer Science Graduate Office. Some of the above materials must be sent to the Graduate School and some to the Department of Computer Science (see below). telephone: (301) 405-4198 All applicants must send the yellow copy of the Application for Graduate Admission , as well as: one copy of transcript(s) Statement of Goals and Research Interests, and if asking for aid, a Request for Merit Based Financial Aid to the Department of Computer Science. Within the University of Maryland, fellowships are available from UMIACS, ISR, and the Graduate School. A number of fellowships from outside of the University of Maryland are also available. To apply for such fellowships, you should contact the agency which administers them, check with the financial aid office in your current university, or contact the Fellowship Office at the University of Maryland. Degree Requirements Below is a summary of the graduate degree requirements. Details are available on request from the Computer Science Department Graduate Office. with thesis are as follows:  coursework must include six hours of CMSC 799 (Master's Thesis Research), a thesis must be prepared that presents an independent accomplishment in a research, development, or application area of computer science, and there will be a final oral examination on the thesis research. Locality and interprocessor communication are the key performance issues for multiprocessors. This is instead of parametrizing the spatial data and treating it as points in a higher dimensional space which is what is done by many researchers. We are working on the integration of non-point representations of spatial and image data as well as nonspatial data into a conventional database management system. The primary running examples that are used are distributed shared memory systems, (mostly) software systems that present the abstraction of shared memory to a collection of workstations connected by general-purpose interconnect. This seminar began with a survey of some of the basic issues in distributed databases and object-oriented databases. Computer Science Department faculty and students work in the Systems Research Center and contribute to research in the areas of automation, database management, and  VLSI.",
