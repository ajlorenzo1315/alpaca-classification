    "Cuerpo": "The Assignment: Set up your MSCC account (instructions here ) and log on. Register yourself on the class mailing list (instructions here ). Hint: http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/341/ Look at the tutorial on how to use the Lisp/Emacs interface on the Course Web. Open a buffer for a new Lisp code file called program.lisp to hold the code for the first asssignment. You should notice on the Emacs status line at the bottom of the window that a lot of ``fi'' code is getting loaded into Emacs. (``Fi'' stands for ``Franz interface,'' and this is the Emacs code that manages the Lisp editor buffers and the interaction between Lisp and the editor.) Type in the simple program here . (You don't have to type in the comments if you don't want.) The main thing to notice while you're doing this is that the Emacs editor will help by indenting your code for you. If you don't see the same indentation pattern as in the sample code, you probably have too many or two few parentheses. Although you have now written a Lisp program, you are not yet running the Lisp interpreter, so there's nobody around to appreciate your great typing job. Start a Lisp process now, as per the instructions in the Lisp/Emacs tutorial . Instructions here ; also see the tutorial . You will get an error message. Have fun playing this exciting game! The tutorial will tell you how. If you're feeling bold, put all your new knowledge together and write your first Lisp program. Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments and prints their sum. It should behave something like this: USER(1): (print-sum 2 -7) The sum of 2 and -7 is -5. Discussion question for class:  what is this NIL thing, and why do we keep seeing it??!?",
