(1/24/95) The boys are gaining control of all their muscles, and naturally their mouths come first. Indeed, it's quite amazing how dramatically his behavior has grown in just two days. I was touched by their obvious love for the babies and their excited interest in playing with and singing to them. With no age difference, Adam and Galen will have a very different relationship. (3/25/96) My secret confession: last night I was the last to bed; as I entered the dark and silent bedroom, I bent down by the bassinets and sniffed my boys. But he didn't quite understand what he was doing. But how could I not love them? The gander hissed at me as I approached his gangly offspring, and I kept my distance not daring to hope that this was the family I had been watching so long. But now, they like it! Two boys? (8/15/96) Galen still isn't crawling, but he has learned to spin around and around on the hardwood floor. (9/2/96) Galen finally started moving last week. I hadn't thought that Galen felt as strongly, but this morning I learned otherwise. I still don't know how he managed to climb over and fall in! Once I prop the door open on the new side, Adam and Galen race for the chance to push it closed again. Then climb out.",
