    "Cuerpo": "At the finish line the name and finishing time of each runner is entered into a computer. Your program should first prompt the user to enter the total number of runners in the marathon and then prompt them to enter the name and finishing time of each runner entered on the same line as shown below. Your program must read in all this data and compute the following statistics: Total number runners. Average finishing time displayed in Hours:Minutes:Seconds format. Standard deviation of finishing times displayed in Hours:Minutes:Seconds format. Example: For the race data given above your program should display (hint: use this to check your results) Total number of runners:          5 First place: Clark Kent Second place: Oprah Winfry Average finishing time:          3:         59:          19 Standard Deviation:          2:         29:          28 Average pace:          9:         8 minute/mile Don't worry if you get extra spaces in your output as shown above. Calculations: For most of the calculations you have to first convert the finishing times from Hours:Minutes:Seconds format to the total number of seconds . For displaying some of the results, such as the average finishing time, standard deviation and average pace, you will have to convert a value in total number of seconds back into Hours:Minutes:Seconds. To determine the first and second place winners you must remember the lowest and second lowest finishing times (in total number of seconds) and the corresponding names. To compute the average finishing time first add up all the finishing times (in total number of seconds). When you have obtained these two sums use the following formulae to compute the mean and standard deviation, where n is the total number of runners. Although you will compute the mean and standard deviation in total number of seconds, they must be displayed in Hours:Minutes:Seconds format as INTEGER s rounded to the nearest second. Use the following formula to compute the average pace. The pace must be displayed in Minutes:Seconds format as INTEGER s rounded to the nearest second. Gradesheet: The following gradesheet will be used to grade this assignment. Note that you will be graded on correct output for the five different sets of input values given below, so before handing it in you must run your program with these values and manually check that your program gives the correct results in all cases. You must enter each runner in the order given. Correct Output                                          [20] 5                                             [4] 'Julie Lewis'  4  12  19 'John Wiley'  2  18  55 'Gareth Bestor'  3  36  2 'Barbara McQueen'  3  41  9 'Diane Meyers'  2  33  17 5                                             [4] 'Julie Lewis'  5  12  19 'John Wiley'  3  18  55 'Gareth Bestor'  4  36  2 'Barbara McQueen'  4  41  9 'Diane Meyers'  3  33  17 5                                             [4] 'Diane Meyers'  2  55  34 'John Wiley'  3  53  9 'Barbara McQueen'  4  24  38 'Julie Lewis'  2  22  46 'Gareth Bestor'  3  36  2",
