Our ongoing research is focussed in two crucial areas of multicast networks: reliable multicast protocols and call admission in multicast networks. We are currently pursuing several related efforts in the area of reliable multicast protocols: A critical issue for multicast applications and the higher layer protocols that support them is the manner in which packet losses occur within the multicast network. Thus, one goal of our recent work [Yajnik et al., 1996] has been to examine the spatial and temporal correlation in packet loss among participants in a multicast session. (Informally, by ``spatially'' correlated loss, we mean  the loss, i.e., lack of reception, of the same packet at many sites; by ``temporally'' correlated loss, we mean the loss of consecutive packets at a given receiver.) In [Yajnik et al., 1996] we present and analyze packet loss data collected simultaneously at up to 12 hosts at geographically distinct locations in Europe and the US. These hosts are connected via the Multicast Backbone (MBone) network Our results show that For most of the traces, the loss on the backbone links of the MBone multicast network is observed to be small (2% or less), as compared to the average loss seen by a receiver. However, due to occasional outages lasting from few seconds to few minutes, in some backbone links, the spatially correlated loss between receivers does go up to 20%, in a few datasets. One or more extremely long loss bursts, lasting from a few seconds up to 3 minutes (around 2000 consecutive packets), occur in almost every trace. (8 consecutive packets) and occurring at 30 sec. intervals. The sender-initiated approach places the responsibility for providing reliable multicast on the sender, which maintains state information on all receivers to which it is multicasting. Each receiver is responsible for detecting lost packets and informing the sender via negative acknowledgments (NAKs) when it requires the retransmission of a packet. In the case of an application consisting of a single sender transmitting reliably to many receivers (referred to as a one-many application) we observe through simple analyses that a simple receiver-initiated protocol which requires receivers to return negative acknowledgments (NAKs) to the sender over point-to-point channels provides substantially better performance (in terms of the maximum supportable throughput of successfully transmitted messages) than a sender-initiated protocol. Further substantial improvement is obtained by the multicasting of NAKs coupled with the introduction of random delays prior to the transmission of a NAK. In the case of an application where all participants act as both senders and receivers (referred to as a many-many application), simple analyses illustrate that the receiver-initiated protocol which requires receivers to return negative acknowledgments (NAKs) to the sender over point-to-point channels almost doubles throughput over a sender-initiated counterpart. We also find that the depending on the network loss rates, either of two NAK based protocols (once which delivers NAKs point-to-point to the sender, and one which multicast NAKs to receivers) has better performance at high arrival rates.
