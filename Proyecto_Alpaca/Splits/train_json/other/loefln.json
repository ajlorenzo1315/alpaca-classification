    "Cuerpo": "The shapes supported by your program include a square, a rectable, an isoscoles triangle, and a diamond. Your program should be menu-driven, so that the user is repeatedly presented with a menu of their options - the various shapes to print, and the current settings of the options (solid or hollow and printing character). If the user enters invalid input, you should display an error message and promt the user to re-enter the information. Instead, you should try writing one function which does the job. For this program, you don't need separate hollow and solid printing functions for each of the different shapes! In addition, it is possible to put the valid-input-checking code in one function and avoid duplicating it all over the place. What to Hand In You should hand in your source code, and the program's output showing all four shapes being printed in both solid and hollow mode. The overall format of the output should be very similar to the sample output below. Notes and Hints Your menu should display the current printing character and whether you are in hollow or solid mode . You must document all of the functions in your program with comments; this documentation should explain what the function does, what the meanings of the inputs and outputs are, and what side effects the function has. For each shape, choose minimum and maximum values for the number of rows, width, etc. Use a loop to check that the value given by the user is in the correct range. The square is just a special case of the rectangle with the same width and height. Q How many rows? C What character to print with? D What size diamond? D - Print a diamond shape   C - Change character (currently &) Q - Print a square          H - Switch between hollow/solid R - Print a rectangle           (currently hollow) T - Print a triangle        X - Exit program -1 is not a valid size. c What character to print with? x Goodbye!",
