To simulate a more realistic setting, and provide a means for your team to thoroughly test the project implementation, you will be required to use the ATM network garbler. The ATM network garbler discards and corrupts (note that no byte in the ATM cell header is corrupted) datagrams according to parameters that are set at run-time. The object code for the garbler is in ~cs640-1/public/garb/atm-garb.o in the instructional machines. The header file is also in the same directory. Note that it is compiled for the Sun SPARCstation 20 (sol1-40). Your program must be compiled under the same environment in order to use the package. And your program should be linked with atm-garb.o . To use the garbler, your program only needs to follow three steps . And instead of using sendto(3) to send datagrams, you must use the garb_sendto() routine provided by atm-garb.o . The parameters for the call remain the same, except that the len parameter must be 53, the ATM cell size. Garb_init() installs a handler for the signal SIGINT, and attempts to set the garbler's parameter values by reading the initialization file atm-garb.init in the process's current directory. The parameter values must be listed one per line in the order shown below, with no intervening blank lines. Suggested default values are listed in parentheses: Probability of discarding a packet. (3) Probability of corrupting a packet. (2) Probability of dropping an AAL6 trailer cell. (3) A sample garbler initialization file, with the suggested default values, is provided in ~cs640-1/public/garb/atm-garb.init . To cause the garbler to have no effect, set the values of the parameters to 0. This is the source of the garbler. Last changed: November 11, 1994 by Kacheong Poon poon@cs.wisc.edu",
