Introduction There has been a growing trend in machine learning toward learning methods that involve interacting with other agents. One such interaction is via advice-taking (Suddarth & Holden 1991), which may well turn out to be the most efficient method for building software-agent architectures. Instruction is steadily increasing in popularity as a method for agent learning (e.g., Gordon & Subramanian 1993, Huffman & Laird 1993, Lin 1993, Maclin & Shavlik 1994, Noelle & Cotrell 1994, Tecuci, Hieb, Hille, & Pullen 1994). Meanwhile, there is also an active interest in agents that learn from observation (e.g., Iba 1991, Lin 1993), as well as agents that communicate and learn from each other (e.g., Etzioni & Weld 1994, Lashkari, Metral, & Maes 1994, Tan 1993).
