    "Cuerpo": "Immediately after leaving the airport on I-80, take the North Temple Street exit off I-80, and go straight on it (you will be headed east, towards the mountains and the downtown area). Stay on North Temple Street into the city, until you come to State Street (which is the same as 100 East Street). There will be a high-rise office building on the corner on your right when you reach State Street. Turn right onto State Street, and go two blocks to 100 South Street. Turn left onto 100 South Street. Stay on 100 South Street, heading east, through town and past the stop lights at 1300 East Street, then University Street, then Wolcott Street. After this curve back towards the right, our building - the Merrill Engineering Building - will be the first building on the right, a low black glass box set back off the street.

It is a nice hotel and has government room rates, but is farther from downtown Salt Lake than some other hotels. In good weather it is within walking distance to the University, and it would likely take only about 5 minutes to drive from the hotel to anywhere on campus. University Park Hotel 480 Wakara Way Salt Lake City (801) 581-1000 If you follow the directions from the Salt Lake Airport to the Computer Science Department, you can easily continue on to the University Park Hotel. Here are the additional directions: When you are heading east (towards the mountain) up 100 South Street, where you would normally turn right into the Merrill Engineering Building parking lot, don't turn, but rather keep driving east untill you come to the next right, which is Wasatch Blvd. Now you should be heading south, with the mountains on your left. Stay on Wasatch Blvd, and you will go through two stop lights. At the 3rd stop light you come to, you will be at Foothill Blvd, and you will have to turn either right or left. At the very next light, which is Wakara Way, turn left again. The University Park Hotel is on the left side of the street, and should be the first building you come to. Peery Hotel In downtown Salt Lake there is the Peery Hotel. Peery Hotel 110 West 300 South Salt Lake City (801) 521-4300 Brigham Street Inn The Brigham Street Inn is located 11 blocks east from downtown Salt Lake City, and sits between the downtown area and the University. Brigham Street Inn 1135 East South Temple Street Salt Lake City, Utah 84102 (801) 364-4461 Last modified on 30 September 1996",
