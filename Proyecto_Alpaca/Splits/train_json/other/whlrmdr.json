My wife, Charmaine, is from Singapore , which we visited last fall . Our first child, Isis Mei Grant , was born April 9, 1996. She was last measured on 10/9/96. Isis was 27.5\" long and 17 lbs. 4 oz. Seattle There are lots of great things to do around Seattle (see The Emerald Web or U/Seattle , or Seattle's Child On-line for kid stuff) and great parks to visit when it isn't raining . Interests My main extracurricular activity is now playing with and caring for my daughter, Isis . I thought it might be a neat idea to start a bonsai tree that would then be as old as she was, so I've planted a seed of a neat little tree with tiny oranges. Since the birth of my daughter, I've also become much more interested in politics and classical music (hmm...) . While in the car, I listen to KUOW FM , the local NPR radio station. At home or in the office (over the web! ), I listen to the local classical station, KING FM . I like to cook and to eat (especially bread ), both of which I'm glad I have to do. I also take time to watch my favorite TV show, Babylon 5 , but have little time for my other interests. When I was in Singapore , I learned how to play xiang qi (Chinese chess) and liked it quite a bit, but I haven't played it much since I got back to the US. If I ever have the time, I'd like to try to write fantasy and science-fiction stories (or even novels!). Sports I enjoy but rarely participate in include racquetball , soccer , basketball , swimming, skiing, skating, cycling , and hiking. 9309 244th St. SW, #K301, Edmonds, WA 98020, phone: (206) 542-0160 When I'm home, I run Red Hat Linux on my Tagram PC .
