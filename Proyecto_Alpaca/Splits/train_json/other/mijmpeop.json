    "Cuerpo": "You may assume that the only objects in your scene will be spheres or polygons, and you may assume that you have only a very few objects in the scene. You should also be able to specify a color for the background of the scene. You should be able to place the viewer anywhere in the scene by specifying an eye, lookat point, and top of head point, and you should be able to specify the width, height, number of pixels wide, and number of pixels high of a window centered a distance d (specified by you) along the viewing vector. You can assume that all light sources are directional (points at infinity), and that you have no more than 3 light sources. All specifications of the scene geometry should be in an ascii input file, which your program reads to produce the internal description of the situation. You then run the ray tracing program to produce an array of pixel colors of the size specified for your window, which your program outputs as a ppm (see below) file. You can then use the filter pnmtotiff to create a tiff file which can be displayed using xv so that you need not write any display software. You will need to write routines for creating a ray from the eye through the center of each pixel in the window, computing the intersection of any ray with a sphere or a polygon, computing the normal to the sphere or the polygon at the intersection point, computing the reflected and refracted (if needed) rays from the intersection point, and computing rays from the intersection point to each light source. You should use the Phong lighting model to evaluate the local illumination for each point, so you will also need a routine to evaluate this model. ppm - portable pixmap file format The portable pixmap format is a lowest common denominator color image file format. A ppm file's magic number is the two characters \"P3\". A width, formatted as ASCII characters in decimal. Whitespace. Whitespace. Whitespace. Width * height pixels, each three ASCII decimal values between 0 and the specified maximum value, starting at the top-left corner of the pixmap, proceeding in normal English reading order. No line should be longer than 70 characters. This variant is different in the following ways: The \"magic number\" is \"P6\" instead of \"P3\". The pixel values are stored as plain bytes, instead of ASCII decimal. The files are smaller and many times faster to read and write.",
