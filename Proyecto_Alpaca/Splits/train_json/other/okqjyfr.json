Emphasis is on techniques of problem analysis and the development of algorithms and programs. The subject of the course is programming, not a particular programming language. CS100B Introduction to Computer Programming An introduction to elementary computer programming concepts. Emphasis is on techniques of problem analysis and the development of algorithms and programs. The subject of the course is programming, not a particular programming language. Alternative version of COM S 100, emphasizing examples and applications involving continuous mathematics, including trigonometry and calculus. CS212 Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs An introduction to programming languages and computer science. Topics covered include functional programming (including recursive and higher-order functions), object-oriented programming, analysis and understanding of algorithms, and correctness of programs. The aim of the course is to expose students to a wide range of interesting and challenging concepts in computing, using programming as a tool. CS401 Programming Languages and Software Engineering An introduction to the programming languages, tools, and methods used in modern software development. Relationship between language and data structure, emphasizing abstract data types. CS414 Systems Programming and Operating Systems An introduction to the logical design of systems programs, with emphasis on multiprogrammed operating systems. CS537 Advanced Database Systems CS 537 (Advanced Database Systems) is intended to give students a solid background in the design and development of database management systems (DBMS's). A number of \"advanced fundamental\" DBMS concepts will be covered. Although this is not intended to be an introductory course, the discussion of various topics will begin with a quick review of basic material. CS611 Advanced Programming Languages A study of programming paradigms: functional, imperative, concurrent and logic programming. Topics include media capture, representation, compression, editing, processing, storage, and transportation. CS681 Analysis of Algorithms Methodology for developing efficient algorithms, primarily for graph theoretic problems. Additional topics such as parallel algorithms and efficient data structures.",
