You will only get the most out of this class if you read the relevant sections of the text before coming to class. edition, by E. Koffman and F. Friedman, 1993. Lecture Notes: Copies of the lecture notes will be available on-line at the end of each week of class. You are responsible for all the material covered in class. Week1 Week2 Week3.1 Week3.2 Week4 Week5 Week6 Week7 Week8 Week9 Week10.1(Heaps) Week10.2(Recursion) Exams and Programming Assignments On Exams and Quizzes: There are three exams: two mid-term exams and one final exam. Exams constitute a total of 60% of your final grade so it is very important to do well on them to ensure a good grade, regardless of your performance on the assignments. All exams are approximately two hours long (though you may stay a bit longer if you need extra time) and are closed-book. Answers are online. Please see me during office hours or send me E-mail. I am not normally in my office except during office hours because I do my research from home via a modem. Click here to send me E-mail. Problem Solving Exercises One of the most important skills you will learn in this class is problem solving . Good problem solving skills distinguish a \"good\" computer programmer from a \"bad\" one - it doesn't matter how familiar or skilled you are in a particular programming language, if you do not understand how to solve the problem then you will not be able to write a computer program for it in any language. This is primarily an exercise in ge neral problem solving so you do not have to write any FORTRAN c ode (though you may if you want to and have time) and your solution/algorithm sh ould not even be dependent on a particular programming language such as FORTRAN. Exercises: Computer Lab You will be using the Vectra lab in Rm. You may also work in any of the other computer labs on campus, however most do not have FORTRAN compilers (please see me first before using the CAE lab ). The software you will be using in the lab includes: Microsoft Windows and MS-DOS E-mail Netscape Other Pointers of Interest CS 302 Home Page Jeff Lampert's Home Page Computer Sciences Department Home Page Starting Points for Internet Exploration Lycos (search the World-Wide-Web by keyword) Dilbert (comic relief for those long nights before an assignment is due) Copyright © 1996 Modified from Gareth S.
