    "Cuerpo": "Table 2 shows that no single service is able to return more then 45% of the references followed by users. Many references returned by services are irrelevant and can be removed if the user is better able to express the query. Table 3 shows that up to 75% of the references returned can be removed if the user supplies a more expressive query. The MetaCrawler has an interface similar to WebCrawler and Open Text in that it allows users to enter a search string, or query , and returns a page with click-able references or hits to pages available on the Web. The insight here is that by separating the retrieval of pages from indexing and storing them, a lightweight application such as the MetaCrawler can access multiple databases and thus provide a larger number of potentially higher quality references than any search service tied to a single database. The MetaCrawler yields a higher proportion of relevant hits by using both a powerful query syntax as well as expert options so that users can more easily instruct the MetaCrawler how to determine the quality of the returned references. The expert options allow users to rank hits by physical location, such as the user's country, as well as logical locality, such as their Internet domain. To confirm this, we used the metric that references followed from the page of hits returned by the MetaCrawler contained relevant information. We calculated the  percentage of references followed by users for each of the search services. When all of these features are used in conjunction, up to 75% of the returned references can be removed. Coverage Given a pre-set maximum on the number of hits returned by each service, we measured both the percentage of references returned as well as references unique to the service that returned them. Table 6: Unique References by Service % of Unique Hits Returned Galaxy 99.6 Yahoo 92.8 Lycos 90.6 WebCrawler 90.3 Open Text 88.8 InfoSeek 79.5 This table shows the percentage of references each service returned that were unique to that service. It shows that nearly 6% of all references returned by InfoSeek were followed. Table 7: Relevance of Returned Hits by Service % of Hits Returned that are Followed Total Hits Followed InfoSeek 5.89 13,045 Lycos 2.56 24,913 Open Text 2.51 4,025 WebCrawler 2.42 21,631 Yahoo 1.33 7,503 Galaxy 0.83 12,022 This table shows the percentage of followed hits for each service. Table 8: Performance of Services Ave. Time (sec) % Timed Out WebCrawler 9.64 2.30 InfoSeek 12.30 3.01 Open Text 16.26 14.13 Yahoo 18.32 2.28 Lycos 18.99 4.87 Galaxy 19.52 3.10 This table shows the average time in seconds taken by each service to fulfill a query. However, while Harvest may have many different interfaces to many different internal services, it is still a search service like Lycos and WebCrawler, instead of a meta-service like MetaCrawler. In order for the MetaCrawler, or any meta-service, to survive in such an economy, it must charge more per transaction than the underlying services, as the MetaCrawler will in turn have to pay each service for its information. Conclusions In this paper we have presented the MetaCrawler, a meta-service for Web searching with additional features designed to return more references of higher quality than standard search services. 7 Michael Schwartz et al.
