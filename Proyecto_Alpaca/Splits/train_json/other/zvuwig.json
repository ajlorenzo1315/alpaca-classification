In this lab you will use physical (i.e. forces and accelerations) descriptions of processes to animate objects. There are several good reasons why you may want to compute motion of objects based on forces, rather than attempt a kinematic description of object motion. It is often easier to write an expression for the forces on an object (a differential equation) than it is to directly describe the motion. For chaotic systems it is impossible to write a kinematic description. Refer to the section on dynamics in the CS 417 page for more information about solving dynamic systems. (The internal state of the module seems to be messed up). Provide an interactor to set the exponent on the law from inverse first power to inverse fourth power. Can you make a stable orbit with just two gravitating bodies for inverse first power or inverse third power force laws? Refer to the dynamics section for more information on water waves. A missing minus sign was added. Modify the water-wave program you just wrote to simulate a cannon firing a ball through the air and into water where it starts a wave. The ball should have initial conditions of position corresponding to the muzzle of the cannon and a velocity consistent with the cannon's altitude (angle with the horizontal) and azimuth (horizontal direction). You should be able to set the altitude and azimuth of the cannon via interactors, which means you will have to detect where and when the ball hits the water surface (which is flat until the ball hits it). There should be interactors to set the force of gravity on the ball, g and the air drag coefficient, r . Be prepared to demo the two programs in section. You will also need to demonstrate mpeg movies of final results including: An orbit (if any), in an inverse first power field. The Lab 10 grading guide will be filled out by a consultant during section to evaluate your work. Land. Copyright Statement",
