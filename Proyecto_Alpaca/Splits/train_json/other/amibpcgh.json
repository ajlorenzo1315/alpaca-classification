    "Cuerpo": "Catherine Starkey A German/English Translator for Simple Sentences This project will take as input a series of sentences in English or German and then parse them according to a corresponding set of grammar rules. Then, using a different set of rules (for the other language), it pieces together the new sentence with words entered in a lexicon. Mao Yonghong Part of Speech Tagging Algorithms I will compare some part of speech tagging algorithms and try to give some suggestions. Eric Scharff Neural Networks for Part of Speech Disambiguation April 29 th Alfred Hong Translation of Regular Query Sentences into SQL Queries The idea of this stems from the numerous Web forms today that provide search capability. Adding a natural language query capability to the search function while providing a back-end conversion to an equivalent SQL query to a database would makes things more human and natural and hopefully more powerful. This work eliminates the multiple parses generated when there is an ambiguous phrase (like a compound noun of five words). David Walker Statistical Methods for Part-of-Speech Tagging Wee-Liang Heng Probabilistic Part of Speech Tagging This project explores various statistical models (e.g., smoothed bigram language model) for part-of-speech tagging, and implements the associated algorithms. The models will be evaluated on their accuracy on either the PennTree Bank or Brown corpus. This project will attempt to take advantage of the fact that certain sequences of words are much more likely than others. In particular, I will assume that grammatical sentences are much more likely than ungrammatical sentences. May 1 st Heji Kim Information Extraction from Poetic Forms The purpose of this project will be to automatically gather useful information from poems via syntactic/semantic parsing; this information will be the search keys to index a corpus of poetry in a database. Vera Kettnaker Deriving the Meaning of Novel Words The idea of this project is to guess the meaning of novel words (first names, abbreviations of new terrorist organizations ect.) on the basis of expectations we gain from the surrounding context. Write several ML programs that will extract information from natural sentences presented in term editor. (say, answer on simplest questions base on given group of sentences). This system will look for \"thematic\" roles associated with the text to provide a summary of the forecast. Time permitting, I will make a program that will interpret this summary data, and generate a weather map that depicts the forecast. Christine R. Paradis Translating an English Sentence to an SQL Statement I will be translating an English sentence to an SQL query. My initial approach to this problem is to use the thematic role information for a given sentence and map this information to the corresponding SQL constructs. For evaluation of the system, I will generate SQL statements for a set of test sentences and compare the results with my desired/correct SQL statements.",
