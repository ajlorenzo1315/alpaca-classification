Karr:  home page David A. Karr:  home page This is the WWW home page used by David A. Karr ( karr@cs.cornell.edu ). Here's my view of the World-Wide Web from the bottom up: David A. Karr (my personal data and research interests). Other students in the CS department at Cornell. The ISIS and Horus projects at Cornell. The Department of Computer Science at Cornell. The CUINFO Web server at Cornell. Other Web servers at Cornell University. Collections of selected pages from all over the Web: The Whole Internet Catalog and Yahoo! Facilities for selecting a few ``best matches'' out of millions of pages on the Web: Lycos and Alta Vista . A Java applet that solves a traditional puzzle about matching birthdays , with the capability to solve some related puzzles. My collection of resources about LEGO toys . Here are a few other Web resources I find handy or interesting: A list of USENET FAQs . My collection of documents on how to write HTML documents (including a home page) for the World Wide Web. Also see the World Wide Web FAQ . The Jane Austen Information Page . The complete plays of another popular screenwriter, William Shakespeare , can be searched with a quite powerful tool, though with a creaky old interface that is barely adaptable to the Web. Motorcycle pages: the Rec.moto/DoD Home Page and information about BMW R-series motorcycles . The Constitution of the United States of America . The weather forecast for Ithaca .
