The Bullies, as you know, have been the 49ers of the Butt-Wipe Division for quite some time. - Ponch Team of Greatness, yes! \"I was reticent in believing that this supposed suck-field really existed, until we suffered a mind-blowing loss to the Boney Turkey's in what was our best-performance. I offer that as proof of the suck-field phenomena. I may not be a smart man, but last weekend I was really an idiot. - Ponch Mr. Miller, how do you explain your poor performance of the last few weeks? - A. Miller Mr. Smith, how do you account for your resurgence into the RB spotlight? I am Emmit. History of the Bullies Phenomena The Bullies made their entrance into the leauge in 1993. \"Ironic that back then, we had Emmitt Smith and Chris Warren, and were still worse than the 1996 Jets.\" \"Emmitt is more than just a franchise player. Barry Foster, Sterling Sharpe, and other similar players were great in their own rights, but none are as consistenly high-scoring and reliable as Emmitt. Emmitt just kicks ass! \"What a dumb-ass!\" Fortunately, owner and GM of the Gridiron pulled an even bigger boner , and actually traded Emmit back to the Bullies for Faulk. When asked by reporters how he felt about returning to the Bullies, Emmitt responded, \"Oh God, please ... yes ... thank you, ... Thank YOU, Flounder\".",
