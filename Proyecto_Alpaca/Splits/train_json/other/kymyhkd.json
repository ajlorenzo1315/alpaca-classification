    "Título": "\nBU CLA CS 480: Introduction to Computer Graphics---Programming Assignment 4\n\t\t",
    "Cuerpo": "You are welcome to choose a project from this list, or you may propose an alternate project. Implement the z-buffering algorithm for shaded rendering of triangles with vertex normals. Your program should allow the user to rotate the scene. Implement a 2-D Bézier curve editor that provides support for quadratic, cubic, and quartic curve segements. The program should allow users to input a series of connected Bézier curve segments, and generate the correct spline. Write a game program (subject to approval). Write an animation program using SPHIGS (subject to approval). I can provide you with the TAR file for building the SPHIGS subroutine library. In building your program, you can use components from the previous assignments as you see fit. You may develop your code on any hardware platform as long as you can demo your project for me in the MCS building on Friday, April 28 . If you propose an alternate project, you will need to e-mail me a one page description of what you plan to do. You can do this in e-mail or you can make an appointment to come by and see me. Grading Demo Part of your grade for this programming assignment will be based on your giving a short demo. You will be expected to talk about how your program works, what algorithms you used, and we will test drive your program. Demos will be scheduled for Friday April 28, from 1:00 to 5:00. Write-up You will also be graded on a brief write-up that is to be turned in at the beginning of class on Friday, April 28. I would also like you to write a discussion of how you made your program more efficient, or how you would have made your program more efficient if you had more time. Extra Credit There is no extra credit on this project; however, you can do two projects and use one to replace the grade on a previous programming assignment. Start programming early.
