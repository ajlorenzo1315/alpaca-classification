There are obvious reasons for working on homework and the project as as a group, but it does take work to make things go smoothly. If you put some effort into make the group work, I believe that you will find doing your work this way much more fun, interesting and ultimately rewarding. Whether you are on the giving or receiving end of an explanation from a friend, you will be learning more than if you were working alone. In your first group meeting you should spend some time talking about how you are going to work. You should start by assigning a group coordinator. This position can rotate among the group members if you like, but there needs to be one person who takes the lead scheduling meetings and deciding on how the group should proceed. At least once every week you should set goals and expectations for the group for the next week and discuss how each person will contribute. You should also take time to review how the group is working and decide on changes. You need to talk these out. But if the group feels that one or two people have done more than their share, then they should indicate this. Here are some arguments often raised and my answer to them: Why should I do the work and someone else get the credit? On the contrary, you will find that you will really understand whatever you teach to someone else. I don't like the people in my group. Why should I have to get along with them to get a grade. Working in groups takes too much time. You should spend some time at first deciding how you are going to work together and what role each person is going to have. Take the attitude that you have a job to get done and ask what needs to happen to get it done. I don't want to have to rely on someone else to do their part. cebeling@cs.washington.edu",
