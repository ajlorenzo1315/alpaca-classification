Once a week, you meet with your TA and the other members of your quiz section. On your own time, you have homework to do, mostly computer programs to design and debug; you will be working on homework more or less all the time. You will also need to use Internet tools (see below ) to keep in touch with the course. A week-by-week lecture schedule may be found on the Web.

If you miss a lecture, talk to a friend who was present, and be sure to check the Web site for class messages and lecture slides. Homework Programming is one of those things you learn by doing. Programming assignments must be done individually, unless explicitly directed. Stapled paper copies of your work may be either turned in at lecture, or put in the CSE Homework box located in the hallway outside of Sieg 128. Late Policy Homework assignments are due by 3:30PM on the assigned day; 25% will be deducted for assignments received between 3:31 and 5:00. Barring exceptional circumstances, homework will not be accepted after 5:00PM.
