To receive a statistics report, a file called \" .statinfo \" should be created in your WWW directory ( ~username/public/html/ ). This file should contain a list of addresses, one per line, to whom the statistics should be mailed. This is similar to a .forward file, except that the address must be a valid internet mailing address, not a program or file. The statistics will be sent to each person on the list every Friday night, shortly after midnight. The statistics file will look something like this: From: www@lucy.cs.wisc.edu Date: Wed, 26 Jul 95 05:08:46 -0500 To: keeper@lighthouse.caltech.edu Subject: WWW Page Statistics (www.cs.wisc.edu) Each URL is followed on the same line by the number of hits it received in the past week. If the information is available, an indented list of pages which contain links to the URL appears below it. /~keeper (3 hits): http://www.washington.edu:1183/ (2) /~keeper/ (3 hits): http://www.washington.edu:1183/ (2) /~keeper/home-sample.html (1 hit): http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~bryan/index.hafh.html (1) /~keeper/installs.html (3 hits): http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~keeper/keeper.html (1) /~keeper/keeper.html (10 hits): http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~bryan/index.hafh.html (1) http://www.cs.wisc.edu/csl/lab-staff.html (1) http://www.caltech.edu/people/www.html (1) /~keeper/pictures/felix.gif (20 hits): http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~samuela/samuela.html (3) http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~pmd/pmd.html (2) http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~masse/masse.html (1) http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~brey/brey.html (4) http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~sbennett/sbennett.html (3) http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~kuong/kuong.html (2) http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~bryan/index.hafh.html (1) http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~fisch/sample.html (1) /~keeper/server.html (11 hits): http://dpls.dacc.wisc.edu/web_talk.html (5) /~keeper/todo.html (13 hits): http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~keeper/keeper.html (2) http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~keeper/ (2) Note that the list of references includes the links from your own documents. This is because not all browsers send the URL for the refering page (referring links are a new feature of the HTTP protocol). This can happen if the maintainer of the referring page removes the link, or more commonly if a user chose \"Open\" and entered the URL for your page while the referring page was loaded into their browser. Please be careful not to overstate the importance of these numbers. If you wish to measure the success of your pages, the number of pages linking to it is probably a much better metric than the hit count.",
