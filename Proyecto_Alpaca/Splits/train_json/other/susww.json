    "Cuerpo": "Applying the definition of , this means we would like to prove the following two facts: For all , if x has an equal number of a 's and b 's then . For all , if then x has an equal number of a 's and b 's. To show the first statement, your proof needs to be structured as follows: Given: any where x has an equal number of a 's and b 's. In your proof, you've been handed a string x and all that you know about it is that it has an equal number of a 's and b 's. That's why in this case, we choose to do an induction on the length of x . You can't do an induction on derivation length here because it is not known whether x can be derived from S (That's what you're attempting to prove). The exam instructions noted one fact that we have about x : since x has an equal number of a 's and b 's, it must be of even length, that is, |x| = 2n where n is the number of a 's (also, the number of b 's). For the inductive hypothesis, we only have two choices here: should we use normal induction or strong induction? We don't really know which to use until we do the rest of the proof, so I'll list them both: (normal) For any x where and x has an equal number of a 's and b 's, . (strong) For any x where x < 2n and x has an equal number of a 's and b 's, . Assume the inductive hypothesis is true and that you have been given some string that has an equal number of a 's and b 's where |x| = 2n . The reason we do this, as we see in the solutions, is that if it does have a non-trivial prefix with an equal number of a 's and b 's, then x is a concatenation of two smaller strings with equal numbers of a 's and b 's. So in the case  where x has a non-trivial prefix with an equal number of a 's and b 's we have shown that . We need to handle every x , though, so what about the case where x doesn't have any such prefix? In each of these cases, w is a string of length less than 2n and has an equal number of a 's and b 's. From this we reasoned about what x might look like: it had some even length 2n , and it may or may not have had a prefix with an equal number of a 's and b 's. Prove: that x has an equal number of a 's and b 's. Here, what you're given and what you're asked to prove are flipped. You're told that x can be derived from S in some number of steps, that is, that for some . Since you're given that x is derivable in i steps, it is perfectly legal to do an induction on i , the length of the derivation, to prove that x has an equal number of a 's and b 's.",
