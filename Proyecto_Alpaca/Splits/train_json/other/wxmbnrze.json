    "Cuerpo": "Articles can be posted to a newsgroup by an individual, and read by anyone who has access to that newsgroup. In several ways, news is superior to e-mail in a group setting, in that it: allows you to make information available to people without filling up their personal inbox gives them the chance to read it whenever they want to, and come back to it for reference when they want results in the storage of only a few centralized copies of an article, rather than a copy in each recipient's inbox. has mechanisms built in for organizing articles in threads of conversation, so that they can be read by topic rather than in the order they were sent out. For these reasons, most class-related conversations are well-suited for the course newsgroup, since they will be sorted by subject, and everyone can read the articles whenever they choose. Accessing Newsgroups There are a number of programs available for reading news, and each one has its own method of displaying news and allowing you to read it. Since most people are familiar with using the web, we'll concentrate here on reading news using netscape. In order to get to a particular newsgroup using netscape, you simply need to access the URL: news:<name.of.newsgroup> For example, the newsgroup for our class is called uw-cs.courses.cse341, so the URL that you would point netscape to is: news:uw-cs.courses.cse341 . Reading and Posting Articles in a Newsgroup Once in a newsgroup, you will see an icon bar (see Figure 1 below), the name of the newsgroup, a list of the articles which you haven't read yet, and a second copy of the same icon bar. That is, whenever a new article is posted, it will be entered into the list. Mark All Articles Read will cause all articles to be marked as though you had read them when you access the newsgroup in the future. This will take you to a new page with a different icon bar (see Figure 2 below) and the article itself. Figure 2 The article icon bar The first two icons in the bar will take you to the previous and next articles in the current thread of conversation (if any). This Newsgroup will take you back to the listing of all articles in the newsgroup. Subscribed Newsgroups will take you to the list of all newsgroups that you are currently suscribed to. Posting Articles and Mailing Responses If you click on an article's author's name, use Post New Article , Post Reply or, Mail & Post Reply , a new window will open up allowing you to type your response. The message will then be mailed to everyone in the Mail To: slot and posted to all newsgroups in the Post To: slot. Keeping up with News When reading news in netscape, you will need to re-load a newsgroup's page from time to time to get new articles which have come in. New articles may be posted to the newsgroup at any time, but netscape will only update your list when you actually reload the page. At that point, it will show you an updated list of articles which you haven't read. Put something like \"please ignore\" or \"no reply necessary\" in your message, or you will get mail back from an automatic mailer telling you that you posted to the newsgroup.",
