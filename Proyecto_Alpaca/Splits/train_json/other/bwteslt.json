    "Cuerpo": "This handout describe some basic computer information for this class. First, there is a web for this class, where I will put assorted information. The class mailing list will be used to communicate useful information for the class. The alias for the class is cse415@ms.washington.edu . Please be careful when responding to messages from the alias that you do not respond to the whole class if you don't want to. Some news readers will reply to all as a default. The basic gist is that you get a Unix account. There is a subdirectory in your home directory, My-Mac-Files , that can be made visible on the Macintosh. Following is a basic explanation of where to find Lisp on the Unix machines and on the Macintosh machines. To invoke it, just click on it. You can use  your account on the MSCC machines to store work on the Macintosh. Click on the MSCC File Server Enter your MSCC name and password and the prompt You will then be prompted which you wish to access. You can choose My-Mac-Files for you own storage space or ClassFolder into which various class files will be placed. The My-Mac-Files that you mount from the Macintosh is the same as the My-Mac-Files in your UNIX home directory. UNIX On the UNIX machines we have Allegro CL 4.1. There is documentation in the MSCC lab. A note about the MSCC machines is that they are load sharing. That means that when you type cl , it will execute on a different machine. Please note that to kill it, you have to kill it on that machine. Joshua Redstone (redstone@cs.washington.edu)",
