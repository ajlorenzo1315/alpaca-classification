Chapter 6, pages 160 -- 162; Problems 1, 2, 7, 8, 12. Packed decimal is an encoding for integers that uses one half-byte per decimal digit. Sign and magnitude:  The high-order bit represents a sign (0 for positive, 1 for negative) and the other bits represent the magnitude. Thus, 10000 0000 0000 0001 is negative 1 and 0000 0000 0000 0001 is positive 1. One's complement: The representation of a positive number is the same as for sign and magnitude. Thus, it is cheaper to implement than sign and magnitude representa- tion. The disadvantage of one's complement is that there are two represen- tations for zero: positive 0 is 0000 0000 0000 0000 and negative zero is 1111 1111 1111 1111. Two's complement: The representation of a positive number is the same as for sign and magnitude. The representation of a negative number is the bit- wise complement of the corresponding positive number, plus 1. This representation has all the advantages of comple- ment encoding but none of the disadvantages; there is only one zero 0000 0000 0000 0000, and carries off the left end may be ingored. See pages 118-19. a. The largest positive floating-point number: 0 1111 1110 111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111  The exponent is not 1111 1111 because that code is reserved for overflow error conditions. See page 135.  an external object is the real-world thing that is being modelled. The program object is the string of bits that represents the external object within a program. A pointer value is the address of a storage object. A pointer variable is a storage object that can store the address of a storage object. A pointer variable is a storage object that can store an address. To \"dereference\" is to FETCH the value from a storage object. pk is a pointer to an integer.",
