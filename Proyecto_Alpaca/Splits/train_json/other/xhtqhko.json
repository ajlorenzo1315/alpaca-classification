    "TÃ­tulo": "CS 537 - Programming Assignment #1",
    "Cuerpo": "Your assignment is to write a program that takes an input file, reads through it line by line, do some simple processing on each line, and then produces some output. Your program, to be called writer , will be invoked: writer filename Your program will open file filename and process it as described below in Program Details . UNIX Manual Pages You should become familiar with the UNIX manuals and the online \"man\" facility. This will be a great help in working on these assignments. You will be mainly interested in the first three sections. Section 2 is for UNIX system calls (calls directly to the UNIX kernel), such as fork , open , or read . Most of what you use will be in the UNIX library routines in Section 3. Program Details Your program will first print out the name of the input file. For more information on C++ input/output, you can read the C++ book or type man iostream man fstream Each line is of the form: character-string  number1  number2 Each of these three pieces will be separated by any number of blank characters (spaces or tabs). For each input line, you will print to standard output (using cout << ) a line containing the character-string , the two numbers, and the sum of the two numbers. UNIX supplies several library routines to make this assignment easier. For example, to convert a ASCII string to a number, you can use atoi or atof (pronounced, \"A to I\", ASCII to integer, and \"A to F\", ASCII to float). Use the \"man\" command to look up the details. To copy strings, you can use strcpy ; to compare strings, you can use strcmp . Do a man string to look up these routines. cout << \"Program \" << argv[0] <<  \" first arg=\" << argv[1]; . } The command line is processed (by the shell) into a list of character strings, one for each argument (including the command name). So, if you typed in the command appearing at the beginning of this assignment, argc would contain the value 2, argv[0] would contain the string \"writer\", and argv[1] would contain the string \"filename\". Deliverables You should hand in a print-out of your program and output from your program on the sample files that we will provide. Last modified: Fri Jan 26 11:26:21 CST 1996 by bart",
