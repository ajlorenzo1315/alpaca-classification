    "Cuerpo": "( 10 points ) Answer the questions  3.1, 3.3, 3.4  from pages 155 -- 156 of Chapter 3 of the text. You will need to read the material on page 163 of the text to answer this question. ( 10 points ) A 16-bit machine using two-address format has three types of instructions as follows: The machine contains 16 registers and the imm-value field of type 3 instructions is 8-bits. In other words the CLA unit has 64 pairs of and inputs. Further, assume that all gates used in the realization of the CLA unit have four or fewer inputs and every gate has a delay of one unit. ( 40 points ) Design a 16-bit adder using carry look ahead method and the gate types from the following list. Save your design as you will need it in the successive homeworks and in the final project. Submit the following; (total number of pages to be submitted for this problem should not exceed 5) One page of your design. Chose inputs such that the worst case path in your design is exercised. Choose a second set of inputs which represent typical inputs. List both these inputs. Simulate both these inputs and submit trace outputs with appropriate comments. The three operations of the PCR are controlled by 2 control lines and . Simulate your design for all three values of the control signals. Submit these values and the trace outputs. Note: You will need to use quicksim with timing mode for these designs. In your design so far you may have seen these values appear with each component. The method to change these values is the same as that to change a text value. Thus you will have to specify both these values for every component used. You will see the impact of delays by looking at the trace window when you simulate the circuit using quicksim in timing mode.",
