The goal of the IVE project is to develop smart cooperative work/play systems that function robustly despite wide variation in network and environmental conditions. We are utilizing planning and machine-learning technology to develop an Internet softbot (software robot), a customizable and (moderately) intelligent assistant for Internet access. Lab) Miscellaneous Computer Vision Demos Expert Systems Screening applications for Graduate School Game Playing Deep Blue Chess Player (IBM) Chinook Checkers Player (Alberta) Diplomacy Machine Learning The ICE Neural Nets Hot List has intro material on artificial neural networks, as well as some Java demonstrations. ALVINN - Autonomous Vehicle Navigation using Neural Nets (CMU) ALVINN uses neural networks to learn visual servoing. It watches a person drive for five minutes, and can then take over driving. ALVINN has been trained to drive on dirt paths, single-lane country roads, city streets, and multi-lane highways. Click here for images of the vehicles and videos of ALVINN in action. Whale Identification using a Decision Tree Natural Language Processing CHAT Natural Language System (Communications Canada) CHAT (Conversational Hypertext Access Technology) is a computer program developed by the Communications Research Centre that provides easy access to electronic information. CHAT provides a natural-language interface that allows users to ask English questions and receive answers. JULIA (CMU) Netsumm - A text summarizer for Web pages (British Telecom) START Natural Language Question Answering (MIT) Ask English questions about the M.I.T. See, for example, snapshots of asking a question , and viewing the answer . Robotics Dante II Walking Robot (CMU) The CMU Field Robotics Center (FRC) developed Dante II, a tethered walking robot, which explored the Mt. Spurr (Aleutian Range, Alaska) volcano in July 1994. The use of robotic explorers, such as Dante II, opens a new era in field techniques by enabling scientists to remotely conduct research and exploration. During following, the stereo system is constantly feeding updated coordinates of the agent being tracked to the mobile robot system. The mobile robot takes these coordinates as goal positions and attempts to attain the goal position while avoiding obstacles using its sonar sensors. The system we are building is a multi-sensor system that integrates work in real-time vision, robotic arm control and stable grasping of objects. Robot Tele-operation (USC) The MERCURY PROJECT allows users to tele-operate a robot arm moving over a terrain filled with buried artifacts. Thus users can \"excavate\" regions within the sand by positioning the arm, delivering a burst of air, and viewing the newly cleared region.",
