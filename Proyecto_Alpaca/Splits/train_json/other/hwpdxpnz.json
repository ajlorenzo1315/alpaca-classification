    "Cuerpo": "We propose an algorithm based on content and structural analysis to form hierarchies from hypermedia networks. Thus, if different hierarchies, each of which gives a different perspective to the underlying information can be formed, the user would be able to comprehend the information better. Although our algorithm is automatic, forming the \"best\" possible hierarchy representing the graph, the user can guide the process so that hierarchies giving different perspectives to the underlying information can be formed. Section 3 shows the implementation of the algorithm in the Navigational View Builder , a system we are building for visualizing the information space of Hypermedia systems [10] , [11] . Content analysis: For content analysis, for each attribute, the nodes of the graph are partitioned into branches based on the attribute values by Content-based Clustering . The root of the pre-tree is a cluster representing all the nodes of the graph. Structural analysis: A pre-tree is formed for nodes in the graph which can reach all other nodes. The user is shown the possible pre-trees that can be selected ranked by the metric and the user can choose one of them. Visualization phase: Besides a 2D tree, the hierarchy can also be visualized as Cone Trees, Treemaps or as a Table of Contents of a book (which is formed by listing the nodes in the order of a depth-first search). IMPLEMENTATION The algorithm has been implemented in the Navigational View Builder, a system for forming overview diagrams of hypermedia systems. The top-level root of this tree and its children are shown in the left hand screen of Figure 3. In this case, the attribute Price was used to form the initial partitioning and the root represents a cluster for all the nodes. In these cases the roots of the tree were identified by structural analysis and they became the children of the overall root. FIGURE 5: Examples of Content and Structural analysis for forming pre-trees. Figure 6 shows a 3D Tree view of this hierarchy. The right hand side of Figure 8 shows a view of a section of this hierarchy where the nodes are listed as a table of content of a book. The left hand screen of Figure 9 represents a treemap view of a hierarchy formed when the initial partitioning is done by the topic of the page. For example, if the original partitioning for forming the hierarchy was done by a quantitative attribute, a linear structure sorted by that attribute can be formed from the subtrees of the root node. Similarly, for the automobile database a Perspective Wall view can be formed where the cars are sorted by the attribute Price . Our work tries to use this philosophy to make a complex hypermedia system understandable to the user.",
