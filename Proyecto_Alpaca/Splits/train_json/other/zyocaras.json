Mooney Proceedings of the 6th International Inductive Logic Programming Workshop , pp. English queries to a small database on U.S. geography were used to test the acquisition of a complete natural language interface, and the parser that CHILL acquired was more accurate than an existing hand-coded system. This paper presents a novel learning approach for control knowledge acquisition that integrates explanation-based learning with techniques from inductive logic programming. Integrating EBL and ILP to Acquire Control Rules for Planning Tara A. Estlin and Raymond J. Mooney Proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Multi-Strategy Learning , pp. Most approaches to learning control information in planning systems use explanation-based learning to generate control rules. This paper presents a novel learning approach for control knowledge acquisition that integrates explanation-based learning with techniques from inductive logic programming. (AAAI-96) This paper presents recent work using the CHILL parser acquisition system to automate the construction of a natural-language interface for database queries. CHILL treats parser acquisition as the learning of search-control rules within a logic program representing a shift-reduce parser and uses techniques from Inductive Logic Programming to learn relational control knowledge. This paper demonstrates the capabilities of FOIDL, an inductive logic programming (ILP) system whose distinguishing characteristics are the ability to produce first-order decision lists, the use of an output completeness assumption to provide implicit negative examples, and the use of intensional background knowledge. This paper presents results from recent experimenets with CHILL, a corpus-based parser acquisition system. CHILL treats language acquisition as the learning of search-control rules within a logic program. This paper presents results on using a new inductive logic programming method called FOIDL to learn the past tense of English verbs. Using Inductive Logic Programming to Automate the Construction of Natural Language Parsers John M. Zelle Ph.D. Thesis, Department of Computer Sciences, University of Texas at Austin, August, 1995. These results support the claim that ILP techniques as implemented in CHILL represent a viable alternative with significant potential advantages over neural-network, propositional, and probablistic approaches to empirical parser construction. A Comparison of Two Methods Employing Inductive Logic Programming for Corpus-based Parser Constuction John M. Zelle and Raymond J. Mooney Working Notes of the IJCAI-95 Workshop on New Approaches to Learning for Natural Language Processing , pp.79-86, Montreal, Quebec, August, 1995. This paper presents results from recent experiments with CHILL, a corpus-based parser acquisition system. The results show that ILP techniques, as employed in CHILL, are a viable alternative to propositional methods and that the control-rule framework is fundamental to CHILL's success. Our approach uses recent machine learning methods for inducing Prolog rules from examples (inductive logic programming). This paper presents a review of recent work that integrates methods from Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) and Explanation-Based Learning (EBL).
