    "Cuerpo": "The other characteristic of particle systems is that there are a large number of particles. Particle systems are used to model \"fuzzy\" objects, such as fire, water, and other dynamic systems that are difficult to model with conventional methods, mainly due to the wide variations in color and shape even for just one moment in time. 3.0 Interdependent Particle Systems In an interdependent particle system, particles can change based on the presence, number, and/or proximity of neighboring particles. For instance, take a fire particle system and a water particle system and mix parts of the systems together- the result is steam. An interdependent system of fire and water interacting to produce steam was the goal and motivation of this research. To determine collision, engergy exchange, or other interactive effects on any particle X, the particle either must search or sum the effects of all its neihgboring N-1 particles. To determine the contributions of the neighbors to particle X, the program would need  to search only the other particles within the bin that particle X is in and all the particles within the immediately neighboring bins --to deal with particles located near the boundaries of a bin. A hundred bins, would also be inefficient for many parts of the particle system where there were large densities of particles-- again the lists to be searched would be in the hundreds per particle negating the effectiveness of using bins. If particle X is attempting to move through a bin, then collision occurs with a probablility equal to the number of particles within the bin divided by the maximum number of particles allowed in the bin. For example, if the maximum number of particles per bin is 30, and there are 19 particles in the bin that particle X is attempting to move through, then there is a 2/3rds chance that particle X will collide. Since the identity of any particle within a bin is lost, a particle that moves from a bin to another bin where it should change state and likewise decrement the opposing particles' states will not have any specific particle with which to interact. The bins therefore must be utilized to pass messages to particles that should die or undergo a loss in energy. It moves into a bin and after all other fire particles have moved it notes that there are 15 particles including itself in the bin. When particle X is reached (or any of the fire particles in the bin) it notes that there are now 9 particles in the bin when their used to be 15. In the provided animation, a particle's temperature is based on the number of particles within the same region of space, while it's motion vector is determined based upon the density of particles immediately within its own space as well as those bins that immediately neighbor the space. There is another benefit to using bins with an interdependent particle systems, parallelization. This can save (given the amount of information each particle must pass as well as the fact that there can be a good number of particles per bin) up to more than 100 times the amount of message passing that needs to be done. Thus, some of the optimizations that are possible for independent systems, are not necessarily possible with interdependent particle systems. 5.0 Conclusions This work has demonstrated that an interdependent particle system approach is feasible and that it is possible to use some of the attributes of the particle system itself to model \"fuzzy\" objects. There are many aspects of interdependent particle systems where research could still be done.",
