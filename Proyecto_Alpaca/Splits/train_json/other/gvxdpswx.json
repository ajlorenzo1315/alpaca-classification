    "Cuerpo": "[5/8/96] Backup your account: Your account on the HP Vectras will be erased shortly after the end of exam week, so if there is anything important that you want to save (i.e. old programs) make sure to do it soon. Also, I will be erasing the class Web site next Friday May 17 so if you want copies of the lecture notes, problem solving solutions, etc, do it before then also. Click here to see the new updated syllabus. [4/26/96] Deleting Program 3 'Results' File: When you run program 3 it will create a new 'Results' file, probably called something like \"results.txt\". Therefore, before you re-run your program you must remember to first delete the old Results file first. Please read the instructions in the assignments carefully and make sure to hand in everything that is required. If this is you then I must get all your output by the end of class Friday 4/12 or you will lose a substantial portion of the marks for the assignment. [4/4/96] Program #1 due date changed: Because there is no class on Good Friday April 5 I have changed the due date for Program #1 to Monday April 8 at 8:50am. If you are having trouble with your assignments you may want to try and go to the lab when one of these people are on duty. This constitutes a \"class handout\" so you are required to be familiar with everything in it. Clue: He works at the same university where I did my undergraduate degree and he teaches philosophy. [3/19/96] Share Your Favorite Web Site: Each week I will get someone different in the class to tell us the URL of an interesting World-Wide-Web site for us to check out. This is intended to get you using Netscape to explore the Web and see what is available on the Internet. Here's a list of those \"discovered\" so far: http://www.warnerbros.com http://www.mapquest.com http://www.wired.com http://www.shareware.com http://www.onsale.com http://www.pctravel.com [3/19/96] Class Mailing List: Please send me a piece of E-mail from the same account you normally read your E-mail from (e.g. your-name@students.wisc.edu ) or otherwise somehow let me know your E-mail address so that I can add you to the class mailing list. Click here to send me E-mail. Sending and Reading E-mail: The default when you first run the E-mail program is to use your Computer Science E-mail account (i.e. your-name@cs.wisc.edu ). To change this go to the \"Special\" menu in the E-mail program, select the \"Configuration\" menu option and change the \"account name\" to your-name@students.wisc.edu . When you send me E-mail make sure you send it from the account you will read your E-mail from because I will reply to the same account that you E-mailed me from. Copyright © 1996 Gareth S.
