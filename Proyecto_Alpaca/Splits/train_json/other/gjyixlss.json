    "Cuerpo": "This means you will only be able to get the assignments and handouts by computer. The first assignment is already ``online'' and it's due a week from today (i.e. November 4) so you must learn how to access the online information soon. All programming assignments will be done on the computers in the ``Vectra Lab.'' You will also turn-in your assignments through the computers in the Vectra Lab. So in addition to learning how to access online class info, you must also set up an account in the Vectra Lab very soon. If you've used the libraries here at UW Madison, then you've used Netscape for access to their electronic card catalogs. In fact, you can use the library terminals to retrieve online information for this course. You can also use Netscape at the various DoIT computer centers around campus, and of course from the computers in the Vectra Lab. Hopefully you already know how to use a web browser--if not, you can see me or ask a consultant in the Vectra Lab (consultants are graduate students who get paid to sit in the Vectra Lab and answer your questions, so use them!). The important part is to \"point\" your web browser at the following address: http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~rmanning/cs110.html Opening an account in the Vectra Lab... You will program and turn-in all your assignments in the Vectra Lab, so it's important to establish an account there as soon as possible. Your first assignment is due September 11th and, although you won't have to write an original program, you will need to work on the Vectra machines. The Vectra Lab is room 1350 of the Computer Science building (1210 W. Dayton Street). Turn left and you'll see the Vectra Lab. When prompted for a password, press ENTER again. It is not generally a good idea to write your password down in case you forget it -- but if necessary, write it down in a safe place. When you login next time, you will use your assigned login name and your newly chosen password, not ``newuser.'' In this class, we will primarily use the following three programs: Borland C++ 4.5, Netscape (represented by a big N), and File Manager. Hopefully you already know how to use Microsoft Windows--you just double-click the mouse on the picture (``icon'') of whatever program you want to run. Program 0: the first assignment... To get the assignment, you must visit my CS110 homepage on the Web (using Netscape as discussed above).",
