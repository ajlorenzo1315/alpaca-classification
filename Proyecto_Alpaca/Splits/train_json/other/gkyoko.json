    "Cuerpo": "The visual query interface manipulates these components to allow the user to specify what data is to be visualized, how data is to be visualized, and where to place the graphics on the display. Session The state of each visual query is stored as a session. How to represent data The following commands are used to specify what the user wants to visualize: Define Mapping Edit Mapping Controlling Shape Size Define Mapping The ``Visualize/Define'' command lets the user define new data streams (TData) and new visualizations to the system. The dynamic nature of editing the mapping is valuable during data exploration because the effectiveness of graphics may vary for different locations in the data, and for different zoom factors as well. What to Visualize There are many ways to specify what the user wants to look at: Control Panel widgets Layout versus Display mode Axes Mouse and Keyboard Events History Window Visual Link Cursor Switch TData Duplicate Window Data Querying Control Panel Widgets The widgets on the control panel are mainly used for navigating the data. Users toggle between these two modes by clicking at the button. Mouse and Keyboard Events The user can use the following mouse commands: Click anywhere in a view with the left button to select the view as the current view. History Window The history window is accessed by clicking the `history' button on the control panel. A history of changes to the visual filter of the current view are displayed. Users can go back to places previously visited by clicking in a history window entry, and then clicking the `use' button on the control panel. Because the history window has a finite size, old history entries are replaced by new ones after the size of the history window reaches it maximum. The cursor menu is used to access cursors: Create: creates a cursor. this is a time save by eliminating the need to use the mapping definition again, when the only difference is that a different input is being used. These functions are accessed through the ``View/Remove from Window'' and ``View/Bring Back to window'' menus. When placed within the same window, the positions of views may also be swapped using the ``View/Swap Position'' menu. In addition, DEVise relies on the window manager of particular implementations for moving a window to a different locations on the display, for changing the size of a window, or for turning the window into an icon. The ``View'' menu is used to operate on views. Widgets The control panel widgets are as follows: mode button: toggle between layout and display modes. Current View widget: displays the name of the current view. xlow/xhigh/ylow/yhigh: click here to transfer this entry of the history window to the xlow/xhigh/ylow/yhigh widgets on the control panel.",
