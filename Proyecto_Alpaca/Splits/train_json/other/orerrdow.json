(2) why couldn't we change it to reject: because then D would accept a different language than N does. I think there was only that one bug relevant to this assignment (which is listed on sipser's web errata page by the way), so I don't think you should need more time, but if you really really want it, I guess I could take #3.2 on monday also. > so I don't think you should need more time, but if you really really > want it, I guess I could take #3.2 on monday also.

In this case, we would have to show 1) when C is enumerable we must construct D and 2) when we have D that C is enumberable, is this correct or am I totally off on a tangent here?

If you recall, this is similar to the HW problem that showed that a language C is enumerable if and only if there is a decidable language D such that a. if x is in C, then for some y, <x,y> is in D b. if x is not in C, then for all y <x,y> is not in D.

The correct definition is that L is self-reducible if there is a poynomial time algorithm that can use the subroutine P for L as a black-box but any calls P(y) made to P must use a y smaller in length than x. If you think about it, by applying f repeatedly, that is, let y=f(f(...(x)...)) so that y becomes small enough, in constant time I can determine if y is in L and conclude if x is in L. Computing y takes only polynomial time since I have to apply f at most |x| times so L must be in P if it is self-reducible. Let L be the language in P and we want to show that L^* is in P. For an input w=a_1 a_2 ... a_n, suppose we define a directed graph G on {1,2,...,n+1} as follows: there is an edge from i to j iff a_i ... a_{j-1} is in L. Then, w is in L^* iff there is a path from 1 to n+1 in G.
