If you do not schedule an appointment, you may find the TA busy helping another student and, thus, unable to spend time with you. Consulting Consulting help will be available in Upson 305. ------------------------------------------ Sun-Thurs  2:00 - 6:00 pm, 7:00 - 10:00 pm Fri        2:00 - 5:00 pm ------------------------------------------ Consultants will answer questions about the computer system, programs, homework assignments, and other things related to the content of the course. To help ensure that consulting time is used to best advantage, we ask you to observe a few ground rules: When your program doesn't work, try to decipher the error message, find the location of the error in your listing, and look at the relevant registers and memory before seeing a consultant. Plan to spend no more than 10 to 15 minutes of the consultant's time. Ford & Topp, Assembly Language and Systems Programming for the M68000, Heath, 1992 Tanenbaum, Structured Computer Organization, Third edition, Prentice Hall, 1990 You are not required to buy the optional books. Handouts and Videotapes Informational handouts and assignments will be distributed in lecture and section. Some copies of the handouts will be available outside Upson 303. You should work in groups of two on the programming and hardware design projects except for the first programming assignment. The same grade will be given to both students. I expect both students to be equally able to answer questions about the program or project. Written problem sets should be turned in to either a CS314 consultant before the due date or at the beginning of the lecture on the due date. Graded assignments will be returned by the consultants during consulting hours the day after the assignment is due. Graded exams wil be returned by the consultants during consulting hours two days after the assignment is due. Answer sheets for all homework assignments and prelims will be distributed one week after the assignment is due. If you believe that we have made a grading error, please first discuss the matter with one of the course consultants or teaching assistants. To submit a problem set, program, or exam for regrading, obtain a regrade request form from one of the consultants or from outside Upson 303. Academic Integrity The work you submit in CS 314 is expected to be the result of your individual effort . Permissible cooperation should never involve a student possessing a copy of all or part of another student's program or other work --- regardless of whether that copy is on paper or in a computer file on a hard disk or a floppy disk.",
