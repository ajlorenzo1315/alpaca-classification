    "Cuerpo": "Comprehensive Examination Questions Fall 1996 The following are three pertinent areas in Computer Science. Answer the question in one of the areas, in detail, within the one hour time period of this examination. Database/Information Systems Traditionally, database systems are designed to manage structured information. With the ubiquitous interest in multimedia systems and the advent of the World-wide Web (WWW or simply Web) in 1993, the distinction between database and information retrieval systems has begun to blur and has raised several challenging database issues. In addition to large storage requirements, video and audio has temporal dimension intrinsic to the data. User queries tend to be incomplete and imprecise. Thus, Web can be viewed as a large, distributed heterogeneous (or multimedia) database system. Several database issues need to be addressed to facilitate retrieving relevant information from the Web efficiently and effectively. Discuss how you would address the following aspects: a. Data modeling to incorporate rich image semantics and temporal dimension in audio and video data. c. Query processing algorithms to incorporate user subjectivity in the interpretation of image contents. Algorithms Discuss in detail the various algorithmic analysis/complexity issues which might arise when developing software that will make extensive use of tree and graph data structures. Cite examples when helpful in your discussion. Network Systems a. What will be the role of the internet in the next ten years? b. Discuss the qualities of two internet providers,  Microsoft Explorer and Netscape Navigator, that make them different from one another. c. Discuss the advantages of object-oriented programming style over other programming styles. Discuss the different uses and new markets for \"personal computing\" and the directions it will take in the next ten years. Discuss what you think might be possible solutions for these problems.",
