    "Cuerpo": "Rather than applying all of its knowledge systematically, the IPR prover picks a single bit of information at a time according to its determination of the current usefulness of the information. The IPR Framework IPR uses the tableaux-calculus for first-order logic theorem proving. This method has some properties which recommend its use by provers which are intended to communicate with non-expert humans. When the theorem prover reaches the q-limit, it chooses a branch of the tableau which needs more work and searches the knowledge base for the most useful bit of information. It determines which theorem to use by comparing the branch (as a sequent) to the theorems in the knowledge base. The success of the prover on traditionally difficult problems shows that this method of storing and fetching theorems has merit. [ Intelligent use of a knowledge base in automated theorem proving. , Challenge problems in first-order theories. ] I am currently preparing more papers for submission. I will attach some of these reports to this page as soon as possible. The English Interface All of the output from IPR is in English. When it finds a proof, it outputs a description of the steps it took and the theorems it applied in a form which might appear in a textbook. (_B) is a linearly independent subset of the vector space (_V) 2. Examples of Proofs The first hard theorem IPR proved in 1994 was the 101st labeled theorem from John Kelley's General Topology : If a product is locally compact, then each coordinate space is locally compact. IPR analyses the knowledge base once for each formula in the proof. In this proof, IPR did not use any of the theorems except the three which are needed in the proof. A second example, this one involving much more complex reasoning, is the following: If S is a Hausdorff topological space, then the diagonal of SXS is closed. The proof of this theorem (given a certain knowledge base) requires the application of twelve theorems. In the presence of a knowledge base containing over 12 theorems, IPR finds this proof in under a minute on my PC at home. Benjamin Shults",
