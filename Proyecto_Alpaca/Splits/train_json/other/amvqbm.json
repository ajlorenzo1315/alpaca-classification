    "Cuerpo": "Demand-driven compilation may be contrasted with runtime code generation that is performed speculatively; with demand-driven dynamic linking in which the address space is modified without \"compilation\"; and self-modifying code in which a code unit is updated by itself which, necessarily, is after the unit has been invoked. The term dynamic compilation is also narrower, typically encompassing code that is generated dynamically but which does not self-modify. Dynamic linking adds code to the instruction space of the program. The code is typically generated using a code generator that is outside of the program. The term runtime compilation is often used to describe loop parallelization that is done at runtime and which performs no code generation. At the moment (1996) most systems that use \"JIT\" by name are systems that use dynamic compilation to get good performance from a portable (machine and/or OS-independent) program representation. JIT is used to refer to code generation at dynamic link time as well as invocation time. The terms code and data are used here in a limited sense. ``Code'' is used to refer to native machine code that is executable except that it may live in a data space instead of a code space. ``Data'' is used to refer to all other state, including bits in an instruction space that are not executable (e.g. are not well-formed instructions) and things that will be manipulted to become code but which are not yet executable native machine code. In particular, ``code'' in a more general sense might include virtual machine code instructions, source text, etc. Faster Dynamic Linking for SPARC V8 and System V.4 . Uses RTCG. Concert used to use (and may again someday use) dynamic compilation in order to transform general-purpose ``remote method invocation'' into a local procedure call. CLIPS uses dynamic linking Compression DLL Dylan uses dynamic linking dld is a dynamic linker provided with Linux. ELF vs. a.out dynamic linking GNU's HURD uses dynamic linking Hypertext using dynamic linking Kaleida 's ScriptX uses dynamic linking. Language extensions use dynamic linking (see also here ) Microsoft Windows has a dynamic linker interface that requires the use of FAR pointers Multics , Multics , OpenDoc and details OS/2 uses dynamic linking Perl also uses Dynamic Linking Ptolemy uses dynamic linking . The Rochelle Caller ID adapter uses dynamic linking Rochester CS uses dynamic linking, e.g. here and here Bradley Schmerl is interested in dynamic linking. In part, this falls under the heading of using dynamic linking because ``it's got a clean interface''. Some of the above plus M.4 expert system ; Numerical C Dynamic Link Library, Ham radio database , DynaComm/Elite 3270 emulation/connection library DEC telephone controller Some libraries are provided as dynamically-linked libraries so that system A can export libraries to a generic application B and B can link in the libraries to operate on the data provided by A. XOR External Object Representation The Cool Edit system , which uses File filters for audio editing Wind/U for providing data exchange between programs on Unix platforms, as in Microsft Windows platforms.",
