What I Like Like many people, I like alot of things, here you go: Arts I am not an artist but I like colorful pictures alot. But after many (I won't tell you how long, just too long) years of learning piano (and gave up at the end), I have come to appreciate a little classical music. Almost all my later piano years I've been playing Stephen Heller(1813-1888)'s boring work. I have never developped a taste for Jazz (some of them are GREAT! I just don't care for). Sure, I like some pop music too. Some of my best pals formed a band called \"Siren\" back a few years ago. I have also the chance to visit some of the most artistic buidlings on the face of the earth such as the St. Peter's Cathedral of Vatican, Taj Mahal in Agra, India and the Opera House in Sydney, Australia. My favourite city in the world is Queens Town, New Zeland, which is a town wrap tight by splendid sceneries. What I dislike Don't get me wrong, I do not promote hatred, but am annoyed by behaviour of some... Not only when they are killing themseleves, they are also endangering the lifes of their neighbours, when they smoke in public, not to mention the unpleasant stinky smell they bring about. (Yes, smokers, you stink !) Most smokers are irresponsible also in a way that most of them do not dispose of their cigarettes properly. All they do is throw them on the ground, or worse still, on the lawn or in the bushes, as if they will vapourize themselves. My little experiment conducted over a period of 2 weeks shows that over 99% of garbage I see on the ground are cigarettes. Of course not, more to come... maybe after I am done with school works...
