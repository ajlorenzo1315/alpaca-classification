    "Cuerpo": "In this exercise you will code the lighting equation as a series of compute statements. For example, you will be able to define a spotlight or make the intensity of an object drop off with distance. To do this, click on each of the filenames shown below. Ambient, diffuse and specular terms are each computed and added together to obtain the intensity of each point. For the initial program it is assumed that the light is at a finite distance from the objects, but the viewer is very far away in a direction V. Some examples of the program's output are shown below. The next image is the same light position, but with the spotlight width=0.0 so that the light is omnidirectional. The bright spots on the surfaces near the light are due to a large (L dot N) in the diffuse term. Notice that the diffuse reflection has the color of the surface, while the specular reflection has the color of the light (white). The example program constructs a surface, calculates the surface normals, then throws away the lighting information to produce an unshaded surface (because there is an AmbientLight module). Modify the program to use the (N dot H) formulation of specular lighting rather than (R dot V). Below is an example of what the modified program might generate. The specular reflection from the horizontal plane is narrow because the angle of incidence is high (the light is grazing the surface). Clarification: You need to make some part of the specular term dependent on the angle of incidence, arccos( L dot N ). The light shown is a omnidirectional light. The definition of the reflection vector, R , is given on page 19 of Watt. The spotlight as given to you has a \"soft\" cutoff with angle. The two images below show a \"soft\" cutoff spotlight and a \"hard\" cutoff spotlight. The light should be a spotlight which flys a curved path, with the direction of the spotlight tangent to the path for about half the flight, then the spotlight should suddenly lock onto one object and remain locked for the second half of the flight. Questions/Writeup: Be prepared to demo all of the functions specified in the first three bullets above: ambient lighting, diffuse lighting, light position, light directionality, and specular reflections of two kinds in one program. What seem to be the differences between the (R dot V) and (N dot H) specular lighting models in terms of the appearance of objects.",
