Realizing such a promise depends on innovations in areas that impact the creation of information services and their communication infrastructures. Realistic deployment scenarios for information-filtering technologies have many differentiating characteristics. For example, the type of information (e.g., TV and radio programming, live news services, electronic mail), and the information transport architecture (e.g., broadcast, narrow-cast, point-to-point) are two of the characteristics which strongly affect the appropriate choice of filtering technology. The success of many new information services that provide end users with access to diverse information sources is crucially dependent on the availability of effective filtering technology. This technology can be used by both the information sources and their end users, to route and control the delivery of information. For example, in the domain of entertainment, the individual information sources may use filters to target material to preferred end user groups, and individual end users may use filters to select the material of their choice out of all available sources. It is now time to focus more attention on receiving information--the process of controlling and filtering information that reaches the persons who must use it.\" Organized and sponsored by Bellcore in cooperation with ACM SIGOIS, the workshop was the first of its kind. The even brought together over one hundred researchers from major university and industrial research labs who share a strong interest in the creation of large-scale personalized information delivery systems. The workshop covered all aspects of this emerging area including its relation to the established field of information retrieval (IR), a variety of methods for filtering, architectural concerns of high-speed filtering systems, and a variety of existing prototype applications, as well as requirements for future applications. In addition, we present four sidebars depicting individual snapshots of an emerging filtering approach or applications. Belkin and Croft ask and answer the question, \"Information Filtering and Information Retrieval: Two Sides of the Same Coin?\" The authors determine that information filtering is a well-defined process. They conclude that the two enterprises have the same goal; namely they are both concerned with getting information to people who need it. The author provides an analysis of successful filtering applications in the context of the personalized multimedia music system. In \"Personalized Information Delivery: An Analysis of Information Filtering Methods,\" Foltz and Dumais present results of an experiment aimed at determining the effectiveness of four information-filtering methods in the domain of technical reports. The experiment was conducted over a six-month period with 34 users and over 150 new reports published each month. Key to realizing the architecture is the on-the-fly data filtering operation, which supports both expanded information retrieval functionality and conflict resolution for management of changes to database contents. We believe that these five articles together with the sidebars capture the excitement and quality of the work as reflected in the workshop.",
