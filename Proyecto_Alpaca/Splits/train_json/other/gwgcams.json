    "Cuerpo": "Consultants will grade your homeworks as well as answer questions about the computer system, programs, homework assignments, and other things related to the content of the course. To help ensure that consulting time is used to best advantage, we ask you to observe a few ground rules: When your program doesn't work, try to decipher the error message, find the location of the error in your listing, and look at the relevant registers and memory before seeing a consultant . If you need more time, then set up an appointment with the TA. For this reason it is not required. Available for $100 at the bookstore in case you have a PPC and want to work at home. Lecture notes, Homeworks, Projects, Exams, and Grades You will have weekly homework assignments and five two-week projects. In order to be able to reach the on-line course materials you need to sign up with the Web page annotation system called CoNote. After all this you should get a message that indicates that you now have permission to author annotations. You are not responsible for changes to an assignment after you have handed it in (e.g., should you hand in something early). You will not be allowed to drop homeworks off: you have to have them graded on the spot! Answer sheets for all homework assignments will be distributed one week after the assignment is due. in the second project you will write a PPPC314 machine language simulator in C. in the third project you will build a PPC314 CPU in three phases: phase1: datapath logic phase 2: datapath implementation, control logic final: all implemented and working You will work in groups of two on all the projects (no exceptions, unless there is an odd number of students). Both students are expected to be equally able to answer questions about the program or project. The projects will be graded on the spot by having you demonstrate them to a TA or course consultant. Homeworks or projects will also be accepted up to 3 calendar days early (e.g., starting monday for homeworks), and each day will work off one demerit (or give you credit for the future). Each demerit left at the end of the course will cost you 0.5% of your grade (almost 1/2 a homework). If, at any time you reach 20 demerits (there goes 10% of your grade! If you believe that we have made a grading error, please first discuss the matter with one of the course consultants or teaching assistants. Academic Integrity The work you submit in CS 314 is expected to be the result of your individual effort . Permissible cooperation should never involve a student possessing a copy of all or part of another student's program or other work regardless of whether that copy is on paper or in a computer file on a hard disk or a floppy disk.",
