Note that an image in DX has a physical size corresponding to its initial resolution in world units, e.g.  a 100x200 resolution image is 100 by 200 world units in size in the x-y plane with one corner at the origin. The reduce module lowers the resolution but does not change the size of the image, as you can see from the output of the Statistics modules which are configured to determine the max and min of the x,y coordinates of the image. An image consists of a 2D field of 3-vectors representing the red, green, and blue values at each point. Volume Texture Mapping: A volume texture map (see page 246 of Watt ) produces a surface color on an object which is a function of the 3D coordinates of the surface. The program Volume.net gives an example of two volume textures; stripes and noise (see Images 3a+b ). Two bump maps are shown below, a random perturbation of the normals and one that resembles tiles. Assignment: Construct a scene which includes: A flag of your own design, waving in the wind. An image from the /afs/theory/tc/courses/418/TexMaps directory as a backdrop. A hemispherical mirror which reflects an image of the flag. A flag is reflected in a mirror which is placed behind and below the flag. The sky is an image which has been parametrically warped into a cylinder. Design functions to produce volume textures simulating: a wood grain of concentric growth rings marble fiberglass The new textures should be incorporated into the existing selector list on the control panel. The volume textures supplied in the program are shown below. Bricks with mortar. You must document your code! Layout small groups of modules which fit on one screen and connect them to other groups with transmitters. Back to Main Page Go to Lab 8 Last modified, 1/18/96, B.Land. Copyright Statement",
