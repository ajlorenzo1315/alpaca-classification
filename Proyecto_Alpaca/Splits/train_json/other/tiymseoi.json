This system allows the monthly billing records, and the usage section of the NIH annual report, to be compiled automatically rather than by re-entering data by hand from a standard logbook. Developed a database system for managing the IMR's internal and external projects which also exports a report in a format required for the NIH annual report. Developed and supervised the maintenance of an integrated system of spreadsheets and databases which automate the purchasing and other records for the Laboratory of Molecular Biology, the Integrated Microscopy Resource and the Cellular and Molecular Biology Program. Developed export software and procedures to make existing data available via the Web. With this system, the office need only maintain and update one Cellular and Molecular Biology faculty database and one Molecular Biology staff database, both used internally and automatically exported to printed and Web versions. Developed methods for integrating databases with the Web so that users can search, view and update information over the Web. Systems Analysis, Management and Support Analyze needs and recommend hardware and software for the faculty and staff of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology and the Integrated Microscopy Resource. Order, install and maintain the facilities' diverse software packages. Create flexible standards to minimize software, support and end-user training costs. Train faculty, staff and graduate students in the use of hardware and software. Train and supervise three student employees. Evaluate, install and maintain the following network hardware, software and protocols: Network Hardware: Hubs, Managed Hubs, Bridges, Switches, Routers Network Protocols: AppleTalk, TCP/IP, IPX Network Wiring: LocalTalk, 10baseT, 10baseF, 100baseT Servers: AppleShare, FTP (Unix), Web (NCSA,Webstar) Web-Database Integration: (FileMaker/WebStar) Software License Server: (Keyserver) BBS, Groupware, Email: Manage the Madison Mac User Group BBS (FirstClass) Email Listservers: (ListStar) Web Design and Administration: Web Administrator and Author for the following Web areas: Laboratory of Molecular Biology Integrated Microscopy Resource (A 4-Star Magellan Internet Site) Cellular and Molecular Biology Program Software Programming and Authoring: Developed the full-color confocal merging software technique that is widely used by microscopists. Co-authored an article describing the technique which appeared in the January, 1993, issue of BioTechniques. Images resulting from this PC software have appeared in Science, Discovery Magazine and on the Disney Channel. Now all confocal microscopes include the ability to create 24-bit color merged files as a standard feature. Developed the initial versions of \"4D Navigator\" Mac software for the viewing of 3D microscope data over time. Developed \"Frogs & Toads of Wisconsin,\" an educational Mac software program, used at the University of WI - Eau Claire  and University of WI - Madison. Developed a PC hardware and software system for the acquisition, analysis and graphing of biological rhythm data. Tuesday, December 10, 1996, 3:35 pm Peter DeVries (pdevries@cs.wisc.edu)",
