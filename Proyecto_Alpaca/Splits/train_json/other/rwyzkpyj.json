    "Cuerpo": "The meeting was attended by over 50 researchers from around the world, including attendees from Australia, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Great Britain, India, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and the United States. The meeting was organized with the aim of bringing together researchers of the mathematical programming aspects of complementarity problems and experts in a variety of applications areas. Sources of complementarity problems are diverse and include many problems in engineering, economics, and the sciences. This includes the growing collection of test problems for MCP, MCPLIB, and the COMPLEMENTARITY TOOLBOX, a suite of programs and routines for use in conjunction with MATLAB. It is hoped that CPNET will allow this collection to grow considerably to include many new algorithms and application problems. Several speakers introduced new extensions of the basic framework, and cited applications that needed such extensions. Some new theoretical results were outlined relating to vertical, horizontal and extended linear complementarity problems, along with several ideas to unify these areas. Several algorithms were given for the solution of these problems, and lots of discussion resulted during application talks relating to reformulating problems into this framework. This appears to be a very fruitful area for future research. For these problems, complementarity is the result of the contact condition which stipulates that the gap between two objects in contact is either zero or the pressure between them is zero. Several very informative and interesting talks opened up these areas to the field in general. In this area, dynamic models are becoming important and several new ideas for tolling and congestion analysis were presented at the meeting. Several new algorithmic developments were outlined at the meeting. A very popular approach takes systems of nonsmooth equations and applies a smoothing so that traditional Newton based techniques could be applied. New computational extensions were also outlined. In conclusion, the meeting showed that the field of complementarity research is a burgeoning area. There are already many interesting algorithms for solving complementarity problems, along with fairly sophisticated techniques for analysis and computation. The growth in the number of new application areas that use this framework will require even more sophisticated solution techniques. Furthermore, it is clear that even more applications will be developed that use complementarity modeling in some form or another, a significant portion of which was made possible by this meeting. Further developments in this area will undoubtedly be reported at the next International Conference on Complementarity Problems.",
