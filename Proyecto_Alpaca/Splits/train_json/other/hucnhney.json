It is our conclusion that this can only be achieved by distributing the vectors in a linear system first, which then induces the matrix distribution. Justification for this lies in the fact that the physical problem leads to a mathematical model, involving two spaces and an operator. It is these spaces that represent the problem. The interface that allows information from the physical problem and/or mathematical model to be passed down to the library is called the Physically Distributed Matrix Interface . Here SL stands for S imple L ibrary. It was created in part to investigate techniques required for the PLAPACK library, and in part to provide an infrastructure for the course \"Parallel Techniques for Numerical Algorithms\" taught by Robert van de Geijn at the University of Texas at Austin. Parallel Linear Algebra Package (PLAPACK): Release R0.1 (Beta) Users' Guide Manuscript in preparation, Aug. 1 version. Sept. 10, 1996 version. Notice that we are changing a number of calling sequences. Due to the inconsistency between the currently available library and this guide, which reflects the next release, it is important to sign our guestbook, so we can keep you informed.
