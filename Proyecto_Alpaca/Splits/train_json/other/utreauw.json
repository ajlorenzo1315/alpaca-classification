Martin (milo@cs.wisc.edu) Program 5 Due Wednesday, October 30, 1996 Objective : Give the student practice with switch statements and for loops. They want to reinforce the ideas of different shapes to their students. Listed below is a description of how they would like the program to run, as well as some examples of the different shapes. Your program should have two layers of menus, all implemented with a switch statement. The main menu consists of a request for either a 4-sided shape menu, a 3-sided shape menu, or to quit. The 4-sided shape menu should present 5 choices: draw one of four 4-sided shapes (square, rectangle, parallelogram, diamond) or to return back to the main menu. A square is a 4-sided shape that has a height the same length as its width with right angles between adjacent sides. A rectangle is a 4-sided shape that may have different lengths for the height and width, but still has right angles between adjacent sides. For this assignment, we are assuming that the requested parallelograms have angles of 45 and 135 degrees only. A diamond is represented as a 4-sided shape with each side equal in length with the corners pointing up/down and left/right. The following are examples of the four 4-sided shapes: *****      *******          ********        * *****      *******         ********        *** *****      *******        ********        ***** *****      *******       ********          *** *****      *******      ********            * Each shape is respectively, a square with sides of length 5, a rectangle with sides of height 5 and width 7, a parallelogram with height 5 and width 8, and a diamond with sides of length 3. After a shape is selected, your program should request for the lengths of the shapes sides. The 3-sided shape menu should present 5 choices: draw one of four 3-sided shapes (all of which are right isosceles triangles) or to return back to the main menu. A right isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length joined at a right angle. After a shape is selected, your program should request the length of the triangle's sides. Note that the length is that belonging to the sides of equal length, so only one length is needed. The drawing of all shapes (3 and 4-sided) should be implemented using for loops. The following error checks must be implemented to receive full credit: Any improper responses during menu selection should result in the user being notified and the menu being presented again. What To Turn In Once you have your program working you should: Print out a copy of each of the eight possible shapes. Created by Dave Eggleston , Rob Muenzenberger, and Mike Steele .",
