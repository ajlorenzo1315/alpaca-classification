    "TÃ­tulo": "CS244a Programming Assignment Rules and Guidelines",
    "Cuerpo": "All of the assignments are designed to be implemented on the Leland cluster in Sweet Hall. At times there will be ambiguities in the assignment specifications, or multiple ways an assignment can be implemented. The TA's may give you advice on the tradeoffs of these decisions, but will not make them for you. We require a makefile to be submitted with each assignment. It checks your program at run-time for many common errors. The first is the source code of your implementation. It is important to adhere to this requirement as some of the assignments are tested by shell scripts and must be graded by hand if your makefile is wrong. If you do not know how to write a makefile, look in the class directory for a sample. and should reside in the same directory as your source code when you submit. The submit script requires the following to be true: The current directory must contain a file called Makefile The current directory must contain a file called either README or README.html There must be at least one file with an extension of .c . If there are any additional required files, these will be listed in the assignment specification and the submit script will check for them as well. If these conditions are true, the script will submit the required files and all other files with an extension of .c or .h in the current directory. Everything needed to compile and run your project should be in the current directory. Honor Code We will enforce adherence to the Stanford Honor Code as it applies to programming assignments. If you have any questions about the honor code, please ask one of the course staff. The remaining 20 points grade the style of your code as specified above. At times there are system problems with the Leland cluster which may prevent you from completing your assignment on time. References and Resources Unix Network Programming by Stevens is the reference of choice for programming the Unix sockets API. Although this book is not a required course text, it is an excellent reference. If you have a question that cannot be answered by any of the class materials or the above references, you should contact your TA.",
