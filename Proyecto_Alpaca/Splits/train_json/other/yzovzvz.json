In this project, we intend to develop a mosaic that allows the user to view an entire three dimensional space (in any one direction at a time) in which his position is fixed at the center. Jon Bodner Hand Gesture Histogram Recognition -- Analysis and Improvement My project is based on the paper \"Orientation Histograms for Hand Gesture Recognition\" by W. Freeman and M. Roth. The algorithm used in the paper is rotation dependent, but it is lighting invariant. For the first part of my project, I intend to implement the Freeman and Roth algorithm and try it out with several sample images I generate. Once the range is determined, I would like to implement a fuzzy function which is used to do the matching between the training sets and the gestures to be recognized. Yanming Cao Hand Gesture Recognition I will implement Freeman's method for hand gesture recognition as described in the paper \"Orientation Histograms for Hand Gesture Recognition,\" by W. Freeman and M. Roth, from Proc. Nirupama Chandrasekaran and Jamie Jason Mosaic Construction using Gaussian Pyramids The goal of image mosaics is to take a collection of images and combine their information in such a way as to obtain a single image. Currently we are proposing that the top of the pyramid be an image that is approximately 16-by-16 pixels. Once we have the Gaussian pyramids we can begin registering at the coarsest level. This hint will be used to reduce the search space to the 8-neighbors of the corresponding pixel in the next lower level. The third section will examine some of these variations with respect to the particular task of identifying circles and ellipses as well as additional variations that are particular to the task of identifying circles and ellipses. I will train a neural network using simple features such as number of corners and edge lengths, and then determine its ability to classify images into shapes. For this project, I plan to implement a gesture recognition method for static hand gestures using orientation histograms described by W. Freeman and M. Roth in \"Orientation Histograms for Hand Gesture Recognition,\" Proc. The pyramid is roughly analogous to the Laplacian Pyramid in that each level corresponds to information at a different scale in the image. The local edge finder can then be set up to look for this signature, as well as the intensity step signifying the boundary. In this paper, we present a algorithm to approximate missing or distorted image information for a textured object. The three methods I intend to implement are interesting because of their relative newness and considerable differences in approaches. The first algorithm I intend to implement comes from the paper, \"A fast histogram-clustering approach for multi-level thresholding\" by Tsai and Chen, which is \"computationally fast and efficient\" and should be a good baseline system to test the other two algorithms against since it does not attempt to consider the global characteristics of the gray level distribution. First, I will be testing the performance of the method using only two baselines, the minimum number necessary for meaningful results.",
