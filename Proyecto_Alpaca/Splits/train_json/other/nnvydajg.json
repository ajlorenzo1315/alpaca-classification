( 20 points ) Answer the questions  2.27 from page 87 of Chapter 2 of the text. You may want to read this chapter by yourself but you should be able to do this problem even without reading the text. ( optional ) Design Architect Training Workbook is available on-line through BOLD Browser . From this workbook do the following lab exercises. Lab exercises 1 to 5 in Module 2 -- pages 2-59 to 2-74 Lab exercises 1 to 4 in Module 3 -- pages 3-59 to 3-82 You need not submit this work. ( optional ) Quicksim II Training Workbook is available on-line through BOLD Browser . From this workbook do the following lab exercises. ( 60 points ) Design a fully synchronous sequential circuit match , to detect a pattern 3201 in a sequence of digits ( 0, 1, 2, 3). This circuit has two input lines (for the encoded input digits), a clock input, and a reset input. The reset input is used to initialize match to an all zero state. Thus on application of reset = high, all the flip-flops in the circuit are set to zero states on occurrence of the appropriate edge of the clock . If the reset is high the output det remains low irrespective of the input sequence. If reset is low, det goes high when the above pattern is found in  the input sequence and the circuit continues to look for another occurrence the same pattern. The clock signal has a period of 100ns and it is low from 0 to 50ns and high from 50 to 100ns. All input signals, namely the signals associated with the input digits and the reset signal, change only in the window +/- 0.1ns of the rising edge of clock . Design your circuit with appropriate state assignment. Remember that the circuit is fully synchronous and the reset input does not reset the flip-flops asynchronously. Your work that is to be submitted for this problem should be no more than five pages . Course Account ece552 Wed Sep 11 11:14:00 CDT 1996",
