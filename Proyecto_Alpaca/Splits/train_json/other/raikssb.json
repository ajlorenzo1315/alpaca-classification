Project 2 is posted October 30th and will be due on November 13th leaving you two weeks to do a good job. Homeworks has been suspended next week as there is a midterm coming up on November 4th. So homework 6 will be posted on November 8th and due on November 15th. Message posted the 3th November. Message posted the 14th November. I have a question about the distinction between nodes and routers that comes up with the homework #6  (problem 1, 3). As far as the problem #4 is concerned, does the source/destination have to keep the internal table as the intermediate routers? Also they could be used as intermediate routers themselves by some other nodes. I am little bit confused about this since you said in class that in some domains only certain nodes may be designed as routers. Which assumption is correct for problem #1? Nodes can be routers. Node is a general term used to designate a point where a link ends. Source is a node and may be a router or is only a router to one of the network router node. So a node, that is not acting as a router need not keep any routing table except to know where to send the information it has to send out. What I said in the class is correct about have designated nodes as routers for external traffic. Subdomains may have other routers for internal routing only. Remember a destination for a particular packet may also be a router (for other packets) but it is not a router for that packet. (or will be covered in the next lecture).",
