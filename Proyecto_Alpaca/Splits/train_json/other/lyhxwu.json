You access this through an icon labeled Email in the Networking folder. If you have problems with your Computer Science email, you should contact your TA or the Computer Systems Lab . Our email service provider is not the same as the campus WiscWorld email service, so DoIT won't be able to help you with any email problems. You can, however, mail to any internet address from the CS accounts, including WiscWorld and CAE accounts. Information on this page includes: Starting the email application Saving an email message Sending an existing file through email Changing your email password Forwarding your email Starting the email application In the \"Networking\" folder in the Program Manager, double-click on the application labelled \"email\". Your initial \"mail\" password is the same as your initial network password. Changing the network password, however, does not change your mail password . Saving an email message If you're using the email software in the 1370 lab, select from the File menu the item Save As . If you're saving the message to be an input file, uncheck the items Guess Paragraphs and Include Headers if they're checked. Click on the Drives pop-up menu underneath the list of files to change the drive to U:, so that the file will be saved in your workspace. (To move out of the current directory, click on the topmost directory icon.) In the dialog that appears, select the document you wish to send. Next, you must click off the Text->Doc button shown in the icon bar. Finally, you can press the Send button. Changing your email password In the \"networking\" folder, double-click on the \"Change Password\" icon. You'll be asked for your name and password again. From here, you can change your email password. Note: The Change Password option in Eudora does not work on our system. If you want your email to be forwarded automatically, please send email to lab@cs.wisc.edu or go to the Computer Systems Lab (on the second floor) during regular business hours.",
