About Windows NT What is Windows NT? Windows NT is designed to be as extensible as possible. Borrowing from the design of CMU's Mach, Windows NT consists of priviledged executive, and a set of non-priviledged servers called protected subsystems. This structure allows protected subsystems to be modified or added without affecting the integrity of the executive. Windows NT is designed to be as portable as possible. The only parts that are written in assembler are those that must directly talk to the hardware, and are carefully isolated from the rest of the system. NT can run on systems with one or more processors. Finally, Windows NT is designed to be fast. At the same time, operating systems for the PC have grown more and more advanced. Note we don't want to make anyone use NT who is more familiar with UNIX, or has reasons for doing work in UNIX. This will just be another option for doing work in the CSRVL. Hardware Right now the CSRVL is populated mostly with SPARC IPC/IPX systems, with a few SparcStation5 machines and PC clones. We will therefore need a number of NT workstations, which will probably be PC clones, and we're also interested in a multi-processor system, which may be Intel or RISC. Microsoft maintains a list of the SMP hardware NT will run on . Their chief drawback is their lack of spatial information, which can lead images with very different appearances to have similar histograms. Unfortunately, we were unable to take the advantage of digital format: I have not seen mpeg players allowing user to skip to arbitrary frame, fast forward, rewind, etc. But it is obvious that video higher structure than frames: we can partition video into shots, scenes and larger chunks, like movies, tv shows, etc. The video source employs a framegrabber and ATM interface card both over PCI. The video source should be compatible with the Cornell IBM SP/2 as well.",
