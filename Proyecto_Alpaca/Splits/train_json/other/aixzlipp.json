    "Cuerpo": "You will write a program with four processes, structure like: The Reader process will read an input file, one line at a time. Reader will take the each line of the input and pass it to process Munch1 . It will then pass the line to process Writer . Writer will write the line to an output file. You should also make sure that each buffer queue is locked separately, so that only the pair of processes using that buffer queue would block. The semaphores should be part of the SyncQueue class definition, so each instance of the class produces a new queue with new semaphores. You will use the semaphore and thread operations supported by the Solaris operating system. We have prepared a summary of the functions that you will use, and special instructions for compiling your program. For this assignment, you must use a Sun workstation running the Solaris operating system. Compiling Your Program You must do a few special things to compile a program to use threads and synchronization. Program Details Your program will create four new threads. To do this, you will start your program and it will create four threads (using the thr_create function). Thread Reader will read in each input line. If the line is longer than 63 characters, it will truncate it to 63 characters (plus the null byte at the end). See the manual page entry for the function \"index\" to making writing Munch1 easier. (Read these function names as \"is lower\" and \"to upper\". Deliverables You should hand in a print-out of your program, including all .C (.cc) and .h files. Do not print the data file nor should you hand in the output of your program.. After your program is completed, you will meet with Muthiah to demonstrate your running program. Make sure that you do not modify your files after you turn in the program. Last modified: Tue Feb 20 09:27:57 CST 1996 by bart",
