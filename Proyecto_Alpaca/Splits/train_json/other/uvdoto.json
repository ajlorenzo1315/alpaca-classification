Wait! I did have some fun, with Intermediate swimming (at the SERF ). I spent my first summer working at IBM's Almaden research center in San Jose , California , working on TPC-D a database benchmark for Decision Support Systems (DSS). I spent this summer in Toronto , which is in the state of Ontario , Canada . I was working on SMP parallelism for DB/2 Client Server. Enough!! Don't you have a life?? My passion is running . I run about 30 miles a week at the shell , in winter, and outdoors in summer, and dream of running a marathon some day. It is Fall, and getting colder as the days go by. I am still running outdoors. It is important to stretch after a run. Picking the right shoe to run in is an extremely important decision. (By the way, I over-pronate, and need a shoe to fix this, so I use a Brooks Beast). It is a good idea to buy a running shoe from a retail running store . I picked a marathon to run. There is group from the UW running club planning a trip to the marathon. Walking is also a good fitness activity to start with if you haven't been running for some time. I run because I am a runner, and that's what we do.",
