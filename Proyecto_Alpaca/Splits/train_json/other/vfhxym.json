    "Cuerpo": "You are run pl and it says cannot find correct type for your machine. Edit the file pl and check that the switch constants are correct for your machine --- maybe you are running on Linux2.x and the switch we have for Linux is Linux1 so you just need to change the 1 to a 2. You will need to rlogin into the machine you ran pl from and kill the process called plm. You do not have write permission to the directory you are running pl from and therefore the server is blocking. There is no executable for the server for the architecure you are running pl from or you don't have permission to run it. Do not use the exit function inside of plinda source code. Instead use pl_exit(int val) which will inform the runtime system that the program is gracefully exiting rather than an exit due to a failure. Check that the .rhosts file has the machine you are running the server on in it. Check that you can execute the daemon for that machine type that is the file ~/plinda/bin/sunos/plinda_daemon (change sunos to solaris or hpux depending on your machine type). You cannot see your applications in the application select box of the user interface. A correct real_main(...) should look like this: real_main(int argc, char **argv, char **env). The system is not able to start applications after clicking on them. The applications are not readable or you have not compiled them for all the machines in your host pool. This is very important since the system may try to run an application on any machine in the pool. Or you need to give the system permission to start an xwindow for the application. This is because some linkers will pick up all functions rather than just the first. This can usually be fixed with the right flags passed to C++ which will pass them to ld or you can copy the libtcl.a and libtk.a libraries to a private directory, and do ar d libtcl.a tclMain.o and ar d libtk.a tkMain.o which will remove the mains from these two libraries. If you still get this problem, make sure the TCL_LIBRARY and TK_LIBRARY are before any others in the link line of obj/Makefile. Last modified by Bin Li . January 21, 1995.",
