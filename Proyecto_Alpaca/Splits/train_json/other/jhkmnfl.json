Bledsoe and Guohui Feng                Dec 1991 Computer Science Department The University of Texas at Austin Austin, Texas 78703 ABSTRACT: In this paper, we describe the rules of the SET-VAR prover, which is an extension of Resolution, and which handles theorems in a subset of second order logic. We also give example proofs using the system, and show that the rules are sound. And we conjecture that the prover is complete for a certain extension of first order logic which includes many of the theorems of real analysis. 406636 atp-116.ps 89738 atp-116.tex A Precondition Prover for Analogy W.W. Bledsoe Computer Science Department The University of Texas at Austin Austin, Texas 78712 We describe here a prover PC that normally acts as an ordinary theorem prover, but which returns a ``precondition'' when it is unable to prove the given formula. To do this, it uses a proof-plan from a given guiding proof to help construct the proof of a similar theorem, by ``debugging'' (automatically) that proof-plan. The given proof-plan for Ex4 is used by the system to prove automatically Ex4; and that same proof-plan is then used to prove Ex4L, during which the proof-plan is ``debugged'' (automatically). 22460 atp-119.ascii ATP 119 May 1993 SET-VAR Implementation W. W. Bledsoe Computer Science Department University of Texas Austin, Texas 78712 This paper describes an implementation of the SET-VAR proof procedure [1]. Even though we believe that SET-VAR is complete for FOL-S, we know that this implementation is not, because we have made several restrictions (see below) in order to speed up the search. We give here a pair of theorems that we hope to use in our Analogy Theorem Proving experiments. They both are Heine-Borel Theorems, the first for the Real Line, R1, and the second for two dimensional real space, R2. The basic idea is to use a proof of the first as a guide to produce (automatically) a proof of the second. Informal Proof of the Heine-Borel Theorem Appendix B.

Theorems and definitions are stored in the knowledge base in the form of sequents rather than formulas or rewrite rules. Because there is more easily-accessible information in a sequent than there is in the formula it represents, a simple algorithm can be used to search the knowledge base for the most useful theorem or definition to be used in the theorem-proving process. This paper describes how the sequents in the knowledge base are formed from theorems stated by the user and how the knowledge base is used in the theorem-proving process. 273543 atp-127a.ps A Framework for the Creation and Use of a Knowledge Base of Mathematical Theorems and Definitions Benjamin Shults Department of Mathematics University of Texas at Austin Austin, TX  78712 bshults@math.utexas.edu This paper covers the framework underlying the IPR prover, some of whose success is illustrated in ATP-127. Theorems and definitions are stored in the knowledge base in the form of ``sequents'' rather than formulas or rewrite rules.",
