From the course catalog description for 3101: Introduction to a programming language. Intended only for those who are already fluent in at least one programming language. Course Requirements and Grading There will be four homework assignments and one final exam. All homeworks and final have the same weight (20%). Homework assignments are handed out each Wednesday and are due one week later at the BEGINNING of the class. During any lag time between the due date and the posting of answers homeworks will be accepted, but will be marked as late. Programming Policy You will need an AcIS computer account. However, the programs must run on AcIS machines. Only those programs submitted electronically by the submit program on the AcIS machines will be accepted and graded. Good programming style will account for a substantial portion of the grade assigned to the programming assignments. The first is a hardcopy (paper) submission to the class folder in the CS department front office. The submit handout describes how to submit your assignments from an AcIS account. Note that both submissions must occur by the deadline on the due date. The hardcopy (paper) submissions of your assignments will be used to write comments and make corrections to your programs and will be returned to you. The electronic submissions will be used to test your programs. Copies of all handouts, including homework assignments and solutions will be made available through this resource. Class Newsgroup AcIS has set up a class account on the cunix machines. You are encouraged to use this resource as a forum for discussion of your projects (see the section on collaboration with other students). See us, leave us a note, or send up e-mail.",
