    "TÃ­tulo": "Emacspeak --A Speech Output Subsystem For Emacs",
    "Cuerpo": "Emacspeak is the first full-fledged speech output system that will allow someone who cannot see to work directly on a UNIX system. (Until now, the only option available to visually impaired users has been to use a talking PC as a terminal.) Emacspeak is built on top of Emacs. There is nothing that you cannot do inside Emacs:-) Publications And Talks CHI 96 Presentation You can also get a text version of the slides. Talk at Stanford on Emacspeak You can also get a text version of the slides. See the news page for details on what's new in the latest release of Emacspeak. I also use  Emacspeak as the only speech output system on my laptop running Linux. On the DECALPHA, you can use it with the software Dectalk. (If you have a DECALPHA and also have software Dectalk installed at your site, please get in touch with Krishna Mangipudi --Digital . See the Emacspeak distribution for additional details. There is an online info manual as well, but this is still incomplete. GNUS: The Emacs news reader. Emacspeak works with VM to present email messages using different voices; Parts of a message that are cited from a previous message are voicified to produce effective aural presentations. (This will be part of Emacs 19.29). Emacspeak also works well with Emacs addons like AUCTEX for editing TeX documents, the Emacs Calculator (CALC --a symbolic algebra system) etc. Support For Emacspeak Emacspeak comes as is, please see the accompanying Copyright notice. See the README file for details about this release and how to install Emacspeak on your system. I work on Emacspeak in my spare time, and may not be able to answer questions  on Emacspeak immediately.
