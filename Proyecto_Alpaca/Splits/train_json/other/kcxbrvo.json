Some projects (marked with a ) have interactive demonstrations available - try them out! SimLab Modeling and Simulation Project Brings together the technologies of geometric modeling, symbolic mathematics, numerical analysis, compilation/code generation, and formal methods to forge new software tools for creating scientific software. Robotics and Vision Lab Focuses on the topics of machine vision, navigation and tracking, robotic manipulation, distributed and cooperative robotics, microelectromechanical systems, planning and control, uncertainty and error, and geometric algorithms. NuPrl provides both a formal system of mathematics and a programming language. It allows the user to express a wide variety of proof and program-building methods as metalevel programs of the system and use these to construct mathematical theorems and evaluate their computational content. HyTech HyTech is an automatic tool for the analysis of embedded systems. HyTech computes the condition under which a linear hybrid system satisfies a temporal-logic requirement. CS-TR Project The Computer Science Technical Report (CS-TR) project is an ARPA-funded consortium of the top five computer science departments (Berkeley, CMU, Cornell, MIT, and Stanford) and the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI). The project's goals are to further research in the electronic publication of technical reports over the Internet and to make available the existing library of technical reports at the member universities. Information Capture and Access The information capture and access research group works on ways that computers can locate information in the ever increasing volume of online data, determine its structure, and extract the information for human users. Active Messages -- High-performance communication Information about developments using the Active Messages communication architecture. Split-C -- A simple parallel extension to C Information about developments of Split-C. CUCS SP-2 -- Computer Science SP-2 info Information about our baby SP-2. ACRI (Advanced Computing Research Institute) The ACRI, under the direction of Thomas F. Coleman , is concerned with scientific computation research and its application to engineering and scientific problems. The ACRI resides in both the Cornell Theory Center and the Computer Science Department . QMG: Finite Element Mesh Generation QMG is a toolkit of C++ and Matlab routines for geometric modeling, unstructured mesh generation for complicated geometries in two and three dimensions, and finite element solution of boundary value problems. This software is available by anonymous FTP. The mesh generation algorithm is based on research by S. Mitchell and S. Vavasis. ARPA funded projects MediaNet: A High-Performance Platform for Network Media Processing MediaNet combines three technologies developed at Cornell to develop a flexible, high performance testbed for storing, transporting, processing, and using multimedia data.
