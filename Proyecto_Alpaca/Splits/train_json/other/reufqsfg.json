    "Cuerpo": "The program will have the user enter values for variables a, b, and c. It will then find all integer solutions to the equation where both x and y are greater than or equal to -5 and less than or equal to +5. We will restrict the user entered values (a, b, and c) to be greater than -10 and less than +10 to simplify the code that does input. Use an 11 x 11 array of bytes to hold all the points on the grid. | X  | Requirements Write this program twice. The first time, write the program in SAL. Then translate the SAL code to MAL. The SAL version is due one week before the MAL version is due. The user input is restricted in form to make the code easier to write. If there is no '-' character, then the integer is positive. The magnitude of the integers is restricted to be less than 10. Since part of the goal of this programming assignment is to gain experience using arrays, the program must use a two dimensional array to store the solutions to the equation for a line. For the MAL version, make sure that all instructions in the program are part of the MAL instruction set. Points will be deducted if SAL instructions or code are included in the MAL version of the program. For the MAL version, you will want to learn to use a different user interface to the simulator. The user interface to sim is graphical -- it gives much more information than simp . Note that sim and simp are scripts that run the same simulator; the difference is the user interface presented. For detailed information, read the document listed under \"Simulator Help\" on the cs354 home page. Handing In the Program Turn in your SAL program (the SAL source code) only once by running the script handin4s program4s.s where program4s.s is the name of the file containing the SAL program. Turn in your MAL program (the MAL source code) only once by running the script handin4m program4m.s where program4m.s is the name of the file containing the MAL program. The representation is IEEE single precision, except that the mantissa field of the representation contains only 6 bits.",
