There may be more issues listed for a project than you can cover. If you do, you might want to come and talk with me so we can work out a reasonable project description. Some projects are appropriate for groups of two or more. In some cases, a project area straddles the boundary between operating systems and some other area (such as database, architecture, artificial intelligence, or programming languages). The project proposal should be brief (two pages or less), but very specific about what you intend to do. The project description should describe the problem that you are addressing, how you will go about working on this project (the steps you will take), what results you expect and what you expect to produce, what resources you will need, and a brief schedule for your project. If time allows, I will also do (c). You should have already done a substantial amount of background work on the project before writing the proposal. For example, if you intend to do a simulation, you should have familiarized yourself with all available software tools, and decided which are most appropriate. in a distributed environment with many (1000 or more) computers. Design a name service for such an environment. (What studies might you do to find out?) What are the limits on the size of the environment that your design will be able to support? You should find as many security problems as possible. The results of this study should be a report of the problems, with suggestions for fixes in the system, system design, and changes in management procedures. You must decide what data is needed, from where the data must come, and how it must be communicated. How can you demonstrate this? You will also need to determine how you might (constructively) use a worm program--i.e., what applications are there for this type of program? Here the problem is that the shadow, which by design runs under the UID of the job's owner and has all of that person's privileges, is vulnerable to ``spoofing'' by software on the server machine.",
