In turn, MSUnet is connected to the Internet. Hence, from almost any computer on campus, you can use the same applications that access the Internet (i.e. regardless of where you are on campus. However, when you leave campus -- your apartment, your hometown, or even your dorm room -- you no longer are have access to these applications because your personal computer is not connected to MSUnet. In order to connect to MSUnet, you will need a modem and communication software that enables you to connect. If you live in Akers, Holmes, or Shaw Halls and have your own computer, click here. Connecting to the MSUnet with a Phone Modem You can connect to Pilot, Gopher, and other Internet services using a personal computer, a modem, and communication software that emulates a VT100 terminal..  Communication software for the Macintosh and IBM PC-compatibles can be obtained free of charge from the MSU Computer Store . The communication software you need varies depending on the type of computer you own and the operating system you are running. For more information about the MSU network and connecting a computer to the network, see NETINFO From the East Lansing area, you can connect to MSUnet for the charge of a local phone call. However, if you leave the East Lansing area and dial into MSUnet using a long distance phone number, you will be charged long distance rates for the duration of your connection. It allows you to connect to MSUnet with a local call from almost anywhere in Michigan. This way, when you go home for vacations, you can still check your email and connect to the Internet through your MSU account. For the Michnet local access number in your hometown, click here . Connecting to the Internet through an On-Line Service On-line services present an alternative way to connect to the Internet. If you have a personal computer and a modem, you can dial into an on-line service, such as America OnLine, Compuserve, Prodigy, etc. Many of these on-line services also provide access to the Internet. This allows you to use Internet email, Gopher, FTP, and other Internet services via their system. If you leave MSU and do not live in Michigan, you may wish to subscribe to one of these services so you can continue to use Internet email to correspond to your friends at MSU and around the world.
