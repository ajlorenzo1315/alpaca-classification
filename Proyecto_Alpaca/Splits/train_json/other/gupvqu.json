Almstrum  | TA: Linyuan Yang COURSE SYLLABUS TABLE OF CONTENTS Course information Meeting time and location Instructor Teaching Assistant Course Topics Study Groups - Collaboration Grading - Regrading system Exams Reading material Homework policy Quizzes Attendance Newsgroup and email Analysis of Programs Unique number: 47605. Course number: CS 336. You should review the lectures, do the readings, and attempt the homework assignments before meeting as a group. Discussion of homework problems is permitted provided all students in a group contribute approximately equal amounts to the discussion. Grading system The course grade will be based on: Homework Assignments = 25% Quizzes (unannounced) = 10% First exam = 15% Second exam = 15% Third exam = 35% No makeup exams will be given. Any request for regrading of a homework paper, quiz, or test must be submitted in writing within 3 class days after the set of papers in question is returned to students. Exams (tentative) Exam 1:  Wednesday, October 2, 1996 (in class). Attendance at exams is mandatory. If an exam is missed, you must submit a written note stating the reason with supporting documentation such as a letter from a doctor. Homework policy Assignments will be given about every 3rd class meeting. Homework must be turned in at the beginning of class on the due date for formal grading. Only a representative sample of the problems on each assignment will be graded, although the same problems will be graded for each student. Your homework grade will be made up of two parts: Points earned for the problems that are carefully graded by the TA (3/4 of the grade on that assignment) A score that indicates the number of problems for which a reasonable attempt is included; this takes into account all problems that were assigned (1/4 of the grade on that assignment) Each homework will be weighted an equal amount in calculating your homework grade, even though the point totals may differ from assignment to assignment. Regular homework assignments are due at the beginning of class. You are expected to have completed the assignment before you arrive in class. Content will be related to material covered in the assigned reading, during lectures, and in your homework assignments. You are welcome to send questions and comments to your instructor or to your TA by e-mail. We'll answer them as soon as we can. In addition to the newsgroup, we will have a parallel email list for broadcast announcements. Last updated 8/29/96 Page prepared by Vicki L. Almstrum .",
