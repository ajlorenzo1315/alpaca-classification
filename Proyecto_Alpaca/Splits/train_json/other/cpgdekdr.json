    "Cuerpo": "The estimation of articulatory parameters is accomplished through a two-step process: an open-loop (table look-up based) initial estimation followed by a closed-loop optimization refinement. Articulatory Shape Estimation Starting from an acoustic input, the open-loop (i.e., with no optimization) estimate of the articulatory parameters is obtained via a table look-up of precomputed synthetic speech representations. Each element in the table is stored with the articulatory parameters from which it was produced. The input speech is compared with the synthetic speech in the table via a spectral representation, and the articulatory shape corresponding to the \"closest\" synthetic speech is selected. Within the closed-loop optimization, synthetic speech is generated from a compact set of articulatory parameters and compared with the input speech using a perceptually weighted distance metric. Articulatory Speech Synthesis As part of this research, two methods of high quality speech synthesis from articulatory parameters are studied. The first method is based on linear acoustic theory/models of speech production, and the second method is based on a fluid-dynamic formulation. Vowel Recognition Using a spectral representation based on linear-predictive poles and a reduced number of articulatory parameters, a vowel recognition system based on an articulatory representation of speech signals has been designed. The Voice Mimic Articulatory Based Vowel Recognition System IV.2. The adaptive voice mimic research has also produced a coding system for vowels and fricative consonants (such as the /s/ in \"sea\" and /f/ in \"fire\"). It was found that spectral comparison based on the poles of linear prediction, which works excellently for vowels, does not work equally well for fricatives. Below, are some coding examples from the voice mimic where the articulatory parameters from the input speech have been used to re-synthesize the speech. In particular, vocal tract parameters can be used to supplement traditional speaker identification methods. Preliminary experiments have been done towards the estimation of the vocal tract length from the acoustic signal. First, the shape of the vocal tract is determined using a codebook built on a fixed vocal tract length. Initial results have been obtained using a database which associates X-ray images of the vocal tract and the corresponding speech signal produced. F. Zussa, Q. Lin, G. Richard, D. Sinder, and J.
