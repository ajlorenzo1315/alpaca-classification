When you type in a command (in response to its prompt), it will create a thread that will execute the command you entered. Your shell will create a thread for each individual command and prompt for more user input when they have all finished. Unlike the real shell, your program only has to deal with a handful of ``built-in'' commands: cat file ... Print the contents of the named files to System.out one after the other. You should also terminate on reaching end-of-file on System.in . Scanning For scanning, you may find it easier to read the entire line into a String object. You could represent an input line as an array of bytes, but you will find it much easier to use a String instead. You may want to look into the class DataInputStream to figure out how to read a line into a String. Commands For the cat command, you should look at the class FileInputStream to see how to read data from a file. Using Threads Your primary class will read a command from a user and then will create a thread to carry out the command. The first is to derive your class from the Thread class and then override its run() function (see pp. 161-162 in the text ). Here you create a class that implements this interface. The former is perhaps easier to understand conceptually but the latter is more general. Exceptions Java requires you to place within a try block any methods that might cause an exception. For example, exceptions such as attempting to open a file that does not exist should result in a message to the user and the continuation of the program. You will be graded not only on the basis of correctness, but also programming style and completeness of test data. Those of you using DOS may want to look into doskey , a little program that provides for easy command manipulation. solomon@cs.wisc.edu Thu Oct 31 15:38:52 CST 1996 Copyright © 1996 by Marvin Solomon.
