    "Cuerpo": "\"Median Years to Ph.D.\" in new Conference Board study of doctorate programs is not what you think! Ed Lazowska Department of Computer Science & Engineering University of Washington September 1995 The just-released Conference Board study of research-doctorate programs in the United States includes a measure for each program labeled \"Median Years to Degree,\" which is widely interpreted to be \"the median number of years that students spend in this graduate program.\" In fact, what the study reports is best described as \"the median number of years that elapse from when the student first enters any educational program in any field at any institution after receiving his/her Bachelors degree, until the student receives his/her Ph.D.\" Suppose, for example, that a student enters a Masters program immediately after receiving his/her Bachelors degree, and graduates from this Masters program in 2 years. But in the Conference Board study, this student will weigh in at 2 + 5 + 4 = 11 years! This semantic confusion is one issue:  we all attribute a particular semantics to the \"MYD\" measure, which is not at all what it actually represents. But many would still be confused by the misleading title. (We do not require a Masters degree en route to a Ph.D., so this number represents \"total time in graduate school\" for a student who enters directly from a bachelors program. Our first step was to calculate the median time spent in our program for graduates in the specific years considered by the Conference Board study. The SED form asks the student for a wide range of data:  year of high school graduation, years of attendance at every college (including 2-year) and graduate institution where the student has spent time, full time equivalent years as a student since receipt of first Bachelors degree, etc. What \"MYD\" Really Means As noted in the preamble, the \"MYD\" measure in the Conference Board study , while widely interpreted to be \"the median number of years that students spend in this graduate program,\" is in fact \"the median number of years that elapse from when the student first enters any educational program in any field at any institution after receiving his/her Bachelors degree, until the student receives his/her Ph.D.\" In disciplines or instances where significant employment occurs between receipt of a Masters degree and entry into a Ph.D. program, the difference can be huge. This is not a measure that we've ever calculated for our graduate program, nor is it a measure that we consider particularly germane. (Pushing a bit harder, it's not even obvious that the time spent in that Masters program elsewhere is germane, since we don't require a Masters degree en route to the Ph.D., and all students, regardless of background, enter our program on an even footing in terms of the \"checkpoints\" of the program.) It's worth noting, though, that even when we use the Conference Board's \"MYD\" definition and calculate this measure from our own database, we obtain somewhat different results than the Conference Board study. A student who enters in September of Year X and graduates in January of Year X+5 actually spent 4.33 years in the program, but will be reported as 5 -- a small but consistent effect, since most students first enroll in the fall. Those students who fall in the median year are considered to have graduated uniformly across that year, and based upon this, an offset within that year is calculated to two digits and reported.) In the case of our own program, four students coded themselves as \"Computer Engineering\" rather than \"Computer Science\" and were attributed to our Electrical Engineering department in the study ... offset by four students we'd never heard of who coded themselves \"Computer Science!\" For simplicity, this explanation has been presented in the context of the University of Washington Department of Computer Science & Engineering, but it applies to all programs surveyed in the Conference Board study. Understanding the definition of \"MYD\" will allow the community to consider if this is the most appropriate measure. The SED form includes a wide variety of data; \"MYD\" is the measure that the Conference Board study has chosen to calculate and use.
