    "Cuerpo": "Since we eventually need to generate a unique set of non-terminals for each a and b in the regular expression, we annotate the expression with indices: . For each set of productions, we denote any starting symbol S as . One grammar for the language described by is then where P is given by the productions below: Suppose where in the given grammar. Properties i) and ii) can be shown to hold for any such x by (strong) induction on the length of the leftmost derivation of x . For all of these prefixes, the number of a 's is at least equal to the number of b 's. (property ii) (Strong) Inductive hypothesis: Assume that properties i) and ii) are true for any where for all . Inductive step: From this we need to show i) and ii) for any where . There are two possibilities for the derivation of x : Since this is a leftmost derivation, we know that that there exist some y and z where . This means that and where k+j=n . (property i) Consider any prefix of x=yz . There are two possibilities: is a prefix of y . Then by property i) for z and property ii) for y . (property ii) Since property ii) holds for y and z we have . So the number of a 's in x is equal to the number of b 's in x . We know that there exists some w where . This means that . (property i) Consider any prefix of x=awb . Then by property i) for w . (property ii) Since property ii) holds for w we have . So the number of a 's in x is equal to the number of b 's in x .",
