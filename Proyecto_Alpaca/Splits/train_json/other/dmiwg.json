    "Cuerpo": "A hash table is a trick for speeding up access to the elements of a linked list by splitting the list into many separate lists (stored in an array). Demos: draw.p . This is a compressed version of the test file drawn in class. Readings: Sections 13.6 and 13.7. Readings: Sections 13.1 and 13.2. Demos: conquest.p This program didn't appear at all in lecture, but I wrote it beforehand while playing around with enumerated data types, and it has some nice examples of doing things with them and 2-d arrays. You should be comfortable with the material in Chapters 1, 2, 3 (Sections 3.1-3.4 only), 4, 5, 6, and Sections 11.1-11.4 and 12.1 and 12.2 in the book. A sample midterm is available showing roughly the length and types of questions you should expect; you may wish to try going through this before the review session to see if you have any questions. Demos: arrayMauler.p 10/9/96 Arrays. Sometimes this isn't what we want, so by used of a global variable or a call-by-reference parameter we can produce procedures like iterators (returning e.g. 1,2,3,4,5, etc.) 10/2/96 Examples of using call-by-reference parameters and functions. Demos: average.p illustrates use of various techniques to return information from procedures. Demos: animation.p Readings: Sections 5.3, 5.5. 9/23/96 More about for loops. Demos: bottles.p \"99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall\" --- a simple program using a for loop. Resist the temptation to read Section 4.5: the description of how to get the mouse position will not work in Think Pascal. Handouts: Homework One Readings: Sections 3.1-3.4, 3.10 (basic graphics commands). Readings: Sections 2.1-2.3, 2.5 (arithmetic); 2.7-2.8 (drawing lines). 9/6/96 Declaring and using constants and procedures. Readings: Sections 1.8 (simple procedures), 2.12 (constants), 6.1 (procedures with parameters).",
