You may assume that exactly one \"last\" bits is asserted, and that there is an initial \"last\" bit at the very beginning of the circuit. (In general, you may make \"reasonable\" assumptions when you feel the problem spec is incomplete or ambiguous. Oct. 31 Homework 4, Problem 7. I changed names in the middle of writing the problem. Oct. 28 There's a new note on doing homework in the homework web page. You are to work together as teams on Homework 4. Then meet together and formulate solutions to each if you can, and assign the writeup to one or more team members. Also, you may make reasonable assumptions when you design this circuit, provided they are reasonable and you explain what they are. There are four delay paths that have to be considered when optimizing the timing of a circuit. Register to output path delay. Input to output delay. (This is all there is for a combinational circuit.) One or the other of us is logged in for most of the 24 hours/day and we can probably save you time. The cse567 mailing list is for all to use - you can post questions to the class if you like, and more important you might want to post hints or suggestions, although we'd rather you vet these through us to avoid the generation of tool rumors and superstitions. Oct. 15 Homework 2 clarification: We will count the cost of a circuit as a) the number of gates and then b) the number of gate inputs. It turns out that the cost of a gate (number of transistors) is directly proportional to the number of inputs, but the delay generally increases as n^2. And it gets worse - increasing the fanout of a signal, ie. So large fanin (number of gate inputs) and fanout (number of places gate output is used) are bad. If you don't have a Web page, this is the time to make one!",
