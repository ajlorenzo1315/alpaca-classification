    "TÃ­tulo": "CSE 341 Overview",
    "Cuerpo": "By the end of the course, you should know enough about programming languages in general that you will be able to pick up new languages easily, be able to evaluate alternative languages and select the most appropriate one to use, and use most languages more effectively. Prerequisite: CSE 143 (either the C++ or the Ada version) Text Pratt and Zelkowitz, Programming Languages: Design and Implementation , Prentice Hall, 1996. The upside is that it is very up to date. Use of World Wide Web We will make frequent use of the World Wide Web to post information, homework assignments, and so forth. Lecture notes for the different topics will be distributed in hardcopy form, but will also be stored in the class web. You can also run Lisp on the MSCC machines (do this if you want to work from home; otherwise the PC implementation should be much faster). Information regarding how to use the PC's will be given out in quiz sections. There will be written assignments on the lectures and textbook and small programming assignments on the languages taught in the quiz sections. There will also be a short paper on another language (described below) that you will present to the class. You will also be required to come in to talk to me for 15 minutes some time during the quarter, either during my office hours or by arrangement at a different time. I recommend that you do this early in the quarter because it's harder to schedule a time at the end. This meeting is simply to allow us to get to know each other better and for me to get feedback on how the class is going. Late Assignments and Incompletes Assignments are due in quiz sections or in lectures, depending on who assigns it. Write your name and quiz section time on the assignment. Late written assignments will not be accepted as the answers will be discussed in the lecture or quiz section. Given that each assignment will not count a lot toward your grade, it may be better just to turn in what you have at the time it is due. Short Paper Teams of two people will each take a language and (1) summarize it according to its basic features (as been done for the languages in Section 2 of the textbook, i.e., History, Hello World, Brief Overview, Data Objects, Sequence Control, Subprograms and Storage Management, and Abstraction and Encapsulation) and (2) evaluate it with respect to criteria that I will describe in class. Although the written version of your paper will be due on the last class meeting of the quarter, you will need to have the material collected and organized by December 2 in order to give your class presentation. In the quiz sections you will learn enough about several languages to write simple programs in them and also will review the material in Part 2 of the book (Chapters 10-14). We will provide more information about the quiz section schedule and assignments at the beginning of class.",
