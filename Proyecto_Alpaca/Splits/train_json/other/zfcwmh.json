This is the reason I can finish the book in one month. The next book I may read is \"3-D Computer Vision\". Learned the Vista and used it to do the HW1. I feel Vista is very useful tool for computer vision research. I just don't know what they were talking about. Database Read the first paper \"\"Granularity of Locks and Degrees of Consistency in a Shared Database\" by Gray, J., et al.. This is a good paper and there are some good ideas in it.

Another is my answer to 25 possible interview questions, the ref. It's a network company and is developing very rapidly. This is the reason why I am interested in CISCO. I think it was a nice talk with interviewer, and gained some useful experience for the next interview. Plan for next month Continue read the book\"\"Database Management Systems\". Begin read book \"3-D Computer Vision\". Look briefly the CS764 report.",
