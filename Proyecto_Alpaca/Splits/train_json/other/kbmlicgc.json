Text:  Artificial Intelligence:  A Modern Approach. The order of reading is on the schedule and the assigned sections must be read before the class lecture. The lecture will cover topics from the reading where additional help, emphasis, and extensions beyond the text are deemed valuable. Time will not always allow complete coverage of all aspects of the reading, but you are still expected to read and understand the text. You will be responsible for all text information from assigned reading, except where specifically noted, on examinations. Homework:  Homework will be assigned with every lectures. Homework questions will come from the text and will be due at the beginning of the following class period. The TA will pass off your assignment at the computer and you will also hand in your documented code. Examinations:  There will be a midterm and a final exam. The final is comprehensive with emphasis on topics not covered on the midterm. Lateness:  Homework and assignments get 10% off if not handed in at classtime and los another 5% for each day late thereafter. However, if you have a good reason for lateness (sickness, etc., something unique from the typical problems of the rest of your fellow students) then you will receive no late penalty. Please hand in late homework to the TA. Nothing will be accepted after the last day of this class. Approximate breakdown is Midterm (25%), Final (30%), Programming Assignments (25%), Homework (20%). If you have a question or concern regarding the grading of your homework or examinations, first talk with the TA. ENJOY!",
