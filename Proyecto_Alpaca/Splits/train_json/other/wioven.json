    "Cuerpo": "In 1968 he became a member of the technical staff at the Rockwell International Science Center, and in 1970 he joined Physical Electronics Industries, Inc., as an entrepreneur, instrumentation engineer, and manager. In 1984 he came to Cornell as professor of electrical engineering and director of the Program on Microscience and Technology, which is sponsored by the Semiconductor Research Corporation. In 1989 he was appointed director of the School of Electrical Engineering. MacDonald has specialized in electron-beam technology, with emphasis on microelectronic applications; he was instrumental in combining Auger electron spectroscopy with scanning electron microscopy and in developing the scanning Auger microprobe. He received the 1973 Victor Macres Memorial Award of the Electron Probe Analysis Society of America and a 1975 Young Engineer of the Year Award presented by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Consequently, research projects that address the generation and application of focused electron beams for nanofabrication, along with computer simulation and modeling, are included in the program. Research subjects include fabrication of nanometer-scale electron devices and nanomechanical structures for information storage; vacuum microelectronics; electron-beam microinstrumentation for lithography and characterization; electron-beam time-resolved probing of integrated circuits and nanostructures; electron scattering and energy dissipation in solids; electron-beam lithography; and nanosensors. The goal of this research is to better understand the physical limits for fabrication, integration, characterization, and inspection of nanostructures.
