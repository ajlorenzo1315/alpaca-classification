Khoros is a fully fledged general programming environment that supports data flow programming. You can quickly develop an application by pasting existing library modules on a workspace, connecting the inputs and outputs of the modules, and run the network of modules. The Khoros system is currently installed on department's SGI's and Suns. Configuration First you have to configure your environment. If you have previously used Khoros 1.0 you should remove from your .cshrc file all the related information. The configuration script creates a file .khoros_env into your home directory. This environment variable is needed if you want to execute the sample workspaces that you can download from the Khoros DIP course. Trying it out You should be now able to run cantata, the graphical user interface of Khoros. Type cantata. If you now get error messages about some missing libraries, you should add setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/X11R5/lib:/usr/openwin/lib:/usr/local/motif-1.2.2/lib:/usropt/lib into your .cshrc, type source .cshrc and try again. If you run mosaic or netscape while running cantata you'll get dozens of warnings about colors that couldn't be allocated and you may end up trying to read white text on white background (which is quite hard...) To test everything is fine, try this exercise. Then go to Visualization menu, choose Non-Interactive Display/Display Image and place it to the workspace to the right from the 2D Gaussian module. Click the option icon of the 2D Gaussian module, it should open you a window with several parameters. After a short while you should get a window with some white Gaussian blur on black background. How to learn more There are some on-line helps that you can access directly from cantata that explain what Khoros and cantata are about and how to use them. There is also a whole course about image processing with Khoros that is really useful. A tip for homeworks and learning You can download fully configured workspaces from the DIP course that demonstrate image processing tricks and how they are done with Khoros (use the Files button on the left of the workspace to load them). If you notice that there is something missing or wrong in these instructions, please send mail to kapu@cs. (Last Update: 18 April 1995)",
