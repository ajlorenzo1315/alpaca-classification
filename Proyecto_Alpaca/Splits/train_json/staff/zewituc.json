Keep shopping. Your IP address is being recorded right this moment... Webology One of the main reasons for this page is that I'm taking a course in \" Advanced Webology \" and need to have a cyberspace playground. This is it. Course Requirement: I have a silly Java applet here. In keeping with my tradition of attempting way-too-ambitious projects, here is my Webology term project on Java Agents . I think that Java is really cool. I just got \"Roaster\", which is a Java development environment for Macintosh. If you are interested in using Macintosh in education or for research, or have an interest in developing Macintosh software, give us a call. ), we'll be doing an OpenDoc hands-on demonstration. Please let me know if either of these interest you, or if you have a particular topic that you'd like to see covered in an AECP seminar. Office Hours My AECP Office Hours are Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday 8:30-9:30. in Computer Science from UVic in 1993. I am the best computer programmer that I know, but I don't know a lot of people. I own a Macintosh. I think astrology is silly. I was born the same day as Albert Einstien (different year). I like to think of myself as creative. My Job In real life, I'm the Manager of the Systems Group at Essential Planning Systems, and I also write a lot of code. EPS doesn't have a Web page yet, which is too bad because that means I can't put a link here.",
