As computer hardware becomes less expensive and as more expectations are placed on software, computers are being placed in control of a wider range of these applications. Software has advantages over conventional technologies, e.g. , flexibility. But these advantages come at a price. Software behavior can be very complex and unpredictable. Perhaps the best publicized example is the Three Mile Island incident, in which operators had great difficulty in diagnosing the state of the system during an emergency. The requirements stage of software development is key to a project's success, especially with respect to safety. For that reason, my colleagues and I have concentrated on requirements, especially the communication of requirements via a requirements specification. The most significant concept that this new procedure borrows from HAZOP is that of a deviation, hence the name deviation analysis . Make deviation analysis software available to UW Safety-Critical Software group. Study the possibility of dynamic display and control of deviation analysis searches.
