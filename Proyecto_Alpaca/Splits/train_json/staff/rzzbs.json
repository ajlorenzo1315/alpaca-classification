    "Cuerpo": "His  work includes (i) research on parallel runtime support and back-end systems for parallel compilers and problem solving environments for multicomputers, (ii) parallel algorithms for scheduling, load balancing, and data distribution for adaptive computations. He co-designed and implemented many key software components of a well-known simulation environment, Parallel ELLPACK .
