Fiuczynski's Home Page Marc E. Fiuczynski's Home Page Marc E. Fiuczynski mef@cs.washington.edu Computer Science & Engineering Department, University of Washington, FR-35, Seattle, WA 98195 USA Background I'm a graduate student at the University of Washington in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering . I grew up in Germany (near Düsseldorf), and spent a few years in High School in Princeton, NJ. I received a B.A. in Computer Science from Rutgers University in 1992 and spent several summers at AT&T Bell Labs and the MITRE Corporation working on a range of projects. I'm the sole proprietor of MEF Systems , a company that I created in December 1993 to sell a distributed, fault tolerant, IP network based telephone system that I built from scratch on a set of VME chasis with 680x0 processors, using UniVoice telephone interface cards and the VxWorks operating system. Most of my time I spend hacking on SPIN , which is a safe, adaptable and extensible operating system. My primary contribution to SPIN is An Extensible Protocol Architecture for Application-Specific Networking . For a demonstration of this work as it services HTTP requests contact http://www-spin.cs.washington.edu . Recent reports and papers An Extensible Protocol Architecture for Application-Specific Networking A design and implementation and performance paper. Describes an extensible protocol architecture that allows anyone to customize an in-kernel protocol graph, which enables applications achieves better performance compared to similar applications running on conventional operating systems. For a demonstration of this work as it services HTTP requests contact http://www-spin.cs.washington.edu . Appeared in the Proceedings of the 1996 Winter USENIX Technical Conference Extensibility, Safety and Performance in the SPIN Operating System A design, implementation and performance paper. Appeared in the Proceedings of the Fifteenth ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles. Language Support for Extensible Operating Systems We've been pretty happy with M3, but we've had to deal with a few shortcomings in order to use the language in a safe extensible operating system. This paper describes how we've addressed those shortcomings. Safe Dynamic Linking in an Extensible Operating System Describes the dynamic linker we use to load code into the kernel. Key point is the ability to create and manage linkable namespaces that describe interfaces and collections of interfaces. Protection is a Software Issue A position paper comparing software and hardware protection mechanisms. Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems. Region Analysis: A Parallel Elimination Method for Data Flow Analysis In IEEE 1995 Transactions on Software Engineering."]'

Fiuczynski's Home Page Marc E. Fiuczynski mef@cs.washington.edu Computer Science & Engineering Department, University of Washington, FR-35, Seattle, WA 98195 USA Background I'm a graduate student at the University of Washington in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering . I grew up in Germany (near Düsseldorf), and spent a few years in High School in Princeton, NJ. I received a B.A. in Computer Science from Rutgers University in 1992 and spent several summers at AT&T Bell Labs and the MITRE Corporation working on a range of projects. I'm the sole proprietor of MEF Systems , a company that I created in December 1993 to sell a distributed, fault tolerant, IP network based telephone system that I built from scratch on a set of VME chasis with 680x0 processors, using UniVoice telephone interface cards and the VxWorks operating system. Most of my time I spend hacking on SPIN , which is a safe, adaptable and extensible operating system. My primary contribution to SPIN is An Extensible Protocol Architecture for Application-Specific Networking . For a demonstration of this work as it services HTTP requests contact http://www-spin.cs.washington.edu . Recent reports and papers An Extensible Protocol Architecture for Application-Specific Networking A design and implementation and performance paper. Describes an extensible protocol architecture that allows anyone to customize an in-kernel protocol graph, which enables applications achieves better performance compared to similar applications running on conventional operating systems. For a demonstration of this work as it services HTTP requests contact http://www-spin.cs.washington.edu . Appeared in the Proceedings of the 1996 Winter USENIX Technical Conference Extensibility, Safety and Performance in the SPIN Operating System A design, implementation and performance paper. Appeared in the Proceedings of the Fifteenth ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles. Language Support for Extensible Operating Systems We've been pretty happy with M3, but we've had to deal with a few shortcomings in order to use the language in a safe extensible operating system. This paper describes how we've addressed those shortcomings. Safe Dynamic Linking in an Extensible Operating System Describes the dynamic linker we use to load code into the kernel. Key point is the ability to create and manage linkable namespaces that describe interfaces and collections of interfaces. Protection is a Software Issue A position paper comparing software and hardware protection mechanisms. Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems. Region Analysis: A Parallel Elimination Method for Data Flow Analysis In IEEE 1995 Transactions on Software Engineering."]'

Weihl , Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Researchers in the Large-scale Parallel Software Group develop new and easier methods of writing efficient parallel programs. Some of the projects in the group are conducted jointly with the Parallel and Distributed Operating Systems Group. Current research is conducted in three major areas. First, work that was begun on the Prelude system is continuing in the AutoPilot project with compiler modifications for C and other widely used languages. The goal of this work is to develop compiler and runtime system mechanisms that raise the level of abstraction of parallel programs, thus making it easier to port or tune a program. Secondly, we are studying architectural and operating system support for low-overhead communication in multi-programmed, multi-user systems. Our goal is to combine the speed of today's high-performance multiprocessors with the protection guarantees of distributed systems. Thirdly, we are developing new techniques for high-performance simulation of multiprocessor systems. Work now under way focuses on a parallel implementation of Proteus, our single-processor simulator. Finally, group members are involved in several projects dedicated to designing and evaluating parallel algorithms and applications."]'

Weihl , Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Researchers in the Large-scale Parallel Software Group develop new and easier methods of writing efficient parallel programs. Some of the projects in the group are conducted jointly with the Parallel and Distributed Operating Systems Group. Current research is conducted in three major areas. First, work that was begun on the Prelude system is continuing in the AutoPilot project with compiler modifications for C and other widely used languages. The goal of this work is to develop compiler and runtime system mechanisms that raise the level of abstraction of parallel programs, thus making it easier to port or tune a program. Secondly, we are studying architectural and operating system support for low-overhead communication in multi-programmed, multi-user systems. Our goal is to combine the speed of today's high-performance multiprocessors with the protection guarantees of distributed systems. Thirdly, we are developing new techniques for high-performance simulation of multiprocessor systems. Work now under way focuses on a parallel implementation of Proteus, our single-processor simulator. Finally, group members are involved in several projects dedicated to designing and evaluating parallel algorithms and applications."]'

Weihl , Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Researchers in the Large-scale Parallel Software Group develop new and easier methods of writing efficient parallel programs. Some of the projects in the group are conducted jointly with the Parallel and Distributed Operating Systems Group. Current research is conducted in three major areas. First, work that was begun on the Prelude system is continuing in the AutoPilot project with compiler modifications for C and other widely used languages. The goal of this work is to develop compiler and runtime system mechanisms that raise the level of abstraction of parallel programs, thus making it easier to port or tune a program. Secondly, we are studying architectural and operating system support for low-overhead communication in multi-programmed, multi-user systems. Our goal is to combine the speed of today's high-performance multiprocessors with the protection guarantees of distributed systems. Thirdly, we are developing new techniques for high-performance simulation of multiprocessor systems. Work now under way focuses on a parallel implementation of Proteus, our single-processor simulator. Finally, group members are involved in several projects dedicated to designing and evaluating parallel algorithms and applications."]'
